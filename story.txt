I met Yimmy in Newtown in May 2024. I was immediately attracted to
her. We shared some drinks and a nice restaurant meal. We had shared
a slow train home (her to Ashfield, me to Flemington/Homebush West) so
we had a lot of time to get to know each other even on our first
meeting.

When I had met Yimmy I had been a widow for seven years after my first
wife passed away from cancer in October 2016. I was very hopeful that my
next relationship would be serious and lead to marriage.

After a few more dates, Yimmy moved in with me at my Unit in
Flemington. Her daughter Gina (living in Ashfield) joined us for
lunch and dinner on several occasions and slept over with us in
Flemington a few times.

Yimmy and I opened a shared bank account which we both contribute to
and use for our everyday expenses. Broadly speaking, Yimmy buys
groceries, clothes and other everyday items and I take care of house
expenses like water, energy and council rates.

I introduced Yimmy to all of my friends soon after we lived together.
We visited my Mother in Deloraine, Tasmania and my
brother in Adamstown, Newcastle in our first few months together. We
also had several weekend trips to Canberra. We spent Christmas 2024 in
Melbourne visiting Yimmys friends in Springvale.

After seven months of living together I proposed marriage to Yimmy
which she accepted. We were married early April 2025 and have been
living together happily ever since. I am very happy with our life
together and consider our marriage a lifelong relationship for both of
us.
