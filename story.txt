I met Yimmy in Newtown in May 2024. I was immediately attracted to
her. We shared some drinks and a nice restaurant meal. We had shared
a slow train home (her to Ashfield, me to Flemington/Homebush West) so
we had a lot of time to get to know each other even on our first
meeting.

After a few more dates, Yimmy moved in with me at my Unit in
Flemington. Her daughter Gina (living in Ashfield) joined us for
lunch and dinner on several occasions and slept over with us in
Flemington a few times.

After seven months of living together I proposed marriage to Yimmy
which she accepted. We were married early April 2025 and have been
living together happily ever since. I am very happy with our life
together and consider our marriage a lifelong relationship for us
both.
