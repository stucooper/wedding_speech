Prelude
-------

This speech is entirely jokes, because that's how I communicate. But
first I have two people that I wish to thank, both seriously and
seriously.

Firstly my wife Yimmy. Welcome to the Cooper family. We are an
extraordinary family and we are an even greater family now that you
have joined us.

My second public thanks are to my son Linus. I said we are an
extraordinary family, and Linus is the most extraordinary Cooper by
about five standard deviations. Linus, I wouldn't have married Yimmy
unless it would work for you as well as for me. Yimmy has lived with
us for over six months, and both of our lives are so much the better
for it. Yimmy has earned her place in our family. If I may presume to
speak on your behalf; Yimmy, Linus joins me in welcoming you to our
family.

OK, let's get to the funnies.

A few weeks ago I was doing up the guest list for tonight. I had
7 or 8 names written down from the top then Yimmy told me that no,
she didn't want any of my ex-girlfriends to come. So it was back to
square one but together we came up with a great guest list and thank
you everyone for coming along tonight.

A lot of wedding speeches start with "I'll keep this short... I'm not
very good at public speaking" but if I said either of those things I'd
be lying. This *will* be a long speech and I am a good public speaker.
When I first moved to Sydney I did Toastmasters Club for a few months
and acheived the rank of Attendee Toastmaster. This is their second
qualification, the first is called Waterboy Toastmaster.

This speech is in four chapters, it is so long that I split it
into chapters so I could write and rehearse it properly. The contents
of this speech are:

Chapter one: My Porn Problem
Chapter two: Thai Culture
Chapter three: Yimmy to the Rescue
and
Chapter Four: Thank the Guests.

CHAPTER 1: MY PORN PROBLEM
--------------------------

It's pretty well known that I have a strong preference for Asian
women. One of my mates once said "You know Stuart you've got a 'thing'
for Asian women and I said "please.. don't call it a 'thing' that word
has all kinds of negative connotations.. I don't have a 'thing' for
Asian women I have a 'fetish' for Asian women. Language is important".

Guys don't often talk about this but a few years ago to be honest I
had a bit of a Porn problem.

There was Nattaporn, Kritaporn and Sumattaporn. It all started
one Friday night years ago. It was the night that Lance Franklin
kicked his 1000th goal at the Sydney Cricket Ground playing for the
Sydney Swans. This is many, many years ago, when the Sydney Swans used
to actually win AFL games at the SCG and when Lance Franklin was a
useful asset to the club. Anyhow, Franklin kicked his 1000th goal in
the final quarter and everyone ran onto the field. The final quarter
took over 65 minutes so instead of an AFL game taking 4 hours it took
5 hours. My SCG guest that night was my good friend Steve Parr, who is
an Englishman who loves snooker and soccer and says that Aussie Rules
football is "bollocks". He didn't say that Aussie Rules was "Aerial
Ping-Pong" he said that watching Aussie Rules players once the ball
hits the ground is like watching seagulls fight over a chip.

Steve and I needed some late night beers after the footy. I
was dressed as "Wally" from the Where's Wally/Where's Waldo books. I
had a red and white striped shirt and a red and white striped wooly hat
on. The hat was knitted for me years earlier in Newcastle by Mum and
it wasn't just made of wool.. the white stripes on the skullcap part
were made of cat fur! In Newcastle we had a longhaired cat and when it
moulted in summer, Mum swept up lots of fur, boiled it in water to
clean it and then turned it into the white half of a red and white
hat. I literally have "The Cat in the Hat".

A lot of Australians give up reading after finishing "The Cat in the
Hat", but please give it another try. You'll get hours of enjoyment,
plus you get to find out why the third little Pig was building his
house out of brick.

The Cat that provided the fur was called Custer, it was a pale ginger
cat and I named it Custer as "The last of the palefaces". When Custer
was just a kitten he had the cute little meow that kittens have and
instead of saying "Meow" he actually said "Yee". Because of this, the
Cooper family have called cats yees ever since and any cat-related
word with an "ee" in the sound gets replaced by "yee" in the
sound. Example Cooper cat joke: Question What crime was the cat
burglar convicted of? Answer: Petty larcenyee. The big cats have
gotten in on the Yee action as well. What did the Snow Leopard say as
he fell off a ledge on the Himalayan mountain? Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!! I
once saw a grey yee sitting on a guy's shoulder, looking just like a
pirate's parrot. The cat said "Yeeces of Eight".

So Steve and I are on the town late on a Friday night and we need a
beer but the first bar we try won't let us in; not because we were
drunk. The security guy didn't like my Wally outfit. I've often been
refused entry to bars for being flamboyantly dressed and security guys
never seem to like me although at least I don't get in fights with
them. Cricket fans will remember that David Hookes got in a fight and
got killed by a bouncer, and a few years Phil Hughes also got killed
by a bouncer.

I knew another bar that always let people in. It was near the Capitol
Theatre in Haymarket, which is the main theatre for live musicals in
Sydney. I saw "Wicked" there and I also saw the Andrew Lloyd Webber
musical "Love Never Dies" which is the sequel to The Phantom of the
Opera. In Love  Never Dies, Christine is now married to Raoul and they
have a child, a 7-year old boy. Everyone thinks the Phantom died in an
Opera House fire. But the Phantom resurfaces, he survived the fire and is
somehow less disfigured than before. He sings that years ago he and
Christine shared a night of passion together. He romanced her with a
candlelight dinner, with over a thousand candles ablaze in the Phantom's
underground lair. 

This is actually why the Phantom had to demand money from the Opera
House managers every month, he had a lighting bill of roughly $4,000 a
month in today's terms. The way Australia is heading with "renewable"
energy and give-all-our-money-to-China Climate Change targets, we'll
all soon have a $4,000 a month lighting bill. If only Australia had
access to the world's largest supply of Uranium, we'd be able to do
something about that.

But back to "Love Never Dies" the Musical. The 7-year old boy is
musically and compositionally gifted. The audience starts to wonder
if Raoul or the Phantom is the father. It turns out that Raoul is
*not* the father and that means that 8 years earlier, Christine
underwent a Phantom pregnancy.

Opera Houses actually burn down pretty regularly. In Venice
Italy there's a famous Opera House Teatro la Fenice, the Phoenix,
which has burned down and been rebuilt three times already. In World
War 2 the Allies bombed the Kroll Opera House in Berlin, the day after
a performance of the final Wagner Ring Opera, Gotterdammerung, The
Twilight of the Gods, which is pretty appropriate when you think about
it. You want an apocalypse? Here's your apocalypse.

The Australian cricket hero Keith Miller flew bombing raids with
Britain's Royal Air Force during World War 2. Keith Miller was a
boys-own adventure hero who along with his cricket also played Aussie
Rules to the highest level and loved horseracing, wine, women and song
and especially Classical Music. After a bombing raid, Miller took an
unauthorised detour over the German city of Bonn, simply because that
was Beethoven's birthplace. Miller refused to accept that cricket was
a dangerous game and said "That's not pressure, pressure is a
Messerschmidt up your arse".

Keith Miller was Richie Benaud's hero, and Richie wore his cricket
shirt wide open in imitaton of Miller, and died of that most
Australian of cancers, Skin Cancer. My dad Mike Cooper played cricket
in a "New South Wales country vs Australia's Best" game in the
1950s, against Keith Miller, Richie Benaud, Alan Davidson, Pete
Philpott, Bob Simpson. This was in the day when the NSW Cricket Team
was in effect the Australian Cricket Team. Dad was probably the tenth
best batsman in New South Wales at the time but never acheived
international honours. He once told my Mum "Ruth, if it wasn't for you
and the kids, I would've played cricket for Australia". I like to
think that Dad was right. He was good friends with an Australian Test
cricketer from Newcastle, Jimmy de Courcy, who played three tests for
Australia in England.

My brother Grahame was for many years a gifted cricketer and I've seen
him smack awesome cover drivess. Grahame played for junior NSW state
teams and once when batting he ran out Mark Waugh. It seemed for a
while that Mike Cooper's son might achieve Australian honours. But it
wasn't Mike Cooper's son who would be an Australian representative, it
was my son, Mike's grandson, who would wear the blazer for an
Australian team. And Mike Cooper lived long enough to see it, and
Grahame drove me to Canberra for the ceremonies.

The woman most responsible for my son representing Australia was my 
first wife Eu Lin and she did not live long enough to see it. She'd
died the previous year. She died of a rare agressive cancer with a
surival chance of fuck-all. She stayed with us for as long as she
could; every year then every month then every week then every day then
every hour.

It takes a while to get over these things. My favourite running gag in
Flying High/Airplane! isn't Surely you can't be serious/I am serious
and don't call me Shirley. My running gag is that the washed-up 
down-on-his-luck pilot Ted Striker is always remembering losing his
squadron in a bombing raid in World War 2. He tells anyone who'll
listen that he was shot down over Macho Grande. Over Macho Grande?
asks the listener. Striker shakes his head sadly and says "I don't
think I'll get over Macho Grande".

Life goes on, for Linus and I, and the story now returns to my Porn
problem. Steve and I were easily admitted to the bar near the Capitol
Theatre. It's called the Chamberlain Hotel and is also called
The C Bar. It's in the Thai part of Sydney. Just as Sydney has a
Chinatown it now has a Thai Town or Thainatown.

Speaking of Chinatowns an American woman tourist in Hong Kong once
asked a Policeman where their Chinatown was. The policeman
replied, quite honestly, that Hong Kong doesn't have a Chinatown. The
tourist walked off disappointed. I hope she was able to find
some authentic Chinese restaurants and other Chinese experiences
during her stay in Hong Kong.

I knew two of the regulars at the Chamberlain Hotel; they were
both poker gamerunners from the legendary Jade Tavern. The first was a
fat Aussie guy named Harry Gelman, he's a lot of fun, the other guy
was a Korean-Aussie guy called Dave Oh who was a bit of a knob to be
honest. They both had Thai girlfriends. Harry and Dave could usually
be found putting what little money they had into the poker machines
at the Chamberlain, while their impossibly beautiful and
unbelievably bored girlfriends watched on.

Harry and Dave weren't there that Friday night but plenty of Thai
people were. Three young ladies, Nattaporn, Kritaporn and Sumattaporn,
had surrounded me. Kritaporn had my special Sydney Swans cat in the hat,
Sumattaporn somehow was now wearing my Swans jersey and Nattaporn was
twerking me to the sounds of the upbeat Thai band playing.

Thai Pop music is so upbeat and cheerful that it makes Korean girl
bands in K-pop sound like Nick Cave covering Leonard Cohen. Yimmy
taught me a Thai pop song all about how a singer loves his girlfriend
even more than he loves eating Donuts. Here is the chorus: "Donut
tamisa miru. Pramen kir Do----nut".

Steve was looking out for me that night. He made sure that this was
all being recorded and sent me the videos afterwards. With his help, I
admitted my Porn problem and now had hard evidence to remind me that
when you want the perfect finish to a great night out, some beers and
dancing in a Thaitown bar is an excellent option.
