Prelude
-------

This speech is entirely jokes, because that's how I communicate. But
first I have two people that I wish to thank, both seriously and
seriously.

Firstly my wife Yimmy. Welcome to the Cooper family. We are an
extraordinary family and we are an even greater family now that you
have joined us.

My second public thanks are to my son Linus. I said we are an
extraordinary family, and Linus is the most extraordinary Cooper by
about five standard deviations. Linus, I wouldn't have married Yimmy
unless it would work for you as well as for me. Yimmy has lived with
us for over six months, and both of our lives are so much the better
for it. Yimmy has earned her place in our family. If I may presume to
speak on your behalf; Yimmy, Linus joins me in welcoming you to our
family.

OK, let's get to the funnies.

A few weeks ago I was doing up the guest list for tonight. I had
7 or 8 names written down from the top then Yimmy told me that no,
she didn't want any of my ex-girlfriends to come. So it was back to
square one but together we came up with a great guest list and thank
you everyone for coming along tonight.

A lot of wedding speeches start with "I'll keep this short... I'm not
very good at public speaking" but if I said either of those things I'd
be lying. This *will* be a long speech and I am a good public speaker.
When I first moved to Sydney I did Toastmasters Club for a few months
and acheived the rank of Attendee Toastmaster. This is their second
qualification, the first is called Waterboy Toastmaster.

This speech is in four chapters, it is so long that I split it
into chapters so I could write and rehearse it properly. The contents
of this speech are:

Chapter one: My Porn Problem
Chapter two: Thai Culture
Chapter three: Yimmy to the Rescue
and
Chapter Four: Thank the Guests.

CHAPTER 1: MY PORN PROBLEM
--------------------------

It's pretty well known that I have a strong preference for Asian
women. One of my mates once said "You know Stuart you've got a 'thing'
for Asian women and I said "please.. don't call it a 'thing' that word
has all kinds of negative connotations.. I don't have a 'thing' for
Asian women I have a 'fetish' for Asian women. Language is important".

Guys don't often talk about this but a few years ago to be honest I
had a bit of a Porn problem.

There was Nattaporn, Kritaporn and Sumattaporn. It all started
one Friday night years ago. It was the night that Lance Franklin
kicked his 1000th goal at the Sydney Cricket Ground playing for the
Sydney Swans. This is many, many years ago, when the Sydney Swans used
to actually win AFL games at the SCG and when Lance Franklin was a
useful asset to the club. Anyhow, Franklin kicked his 1000th goal in
the final quarter and everyone ran onto the field. The final quarter
took over 65 minutes so instead of an AFL game taking 4 hours it took
5 hours. My SCG guest that night was my good friend Steve Parr, who is
an Englishman who loves snooker and soccer and says that Aussie Rules
football is "bollocks". He didn't say that Aussie Rules was "Aerial
Ping-Pong" he said that watching Aussie Rules players once the ball
hits the ground is like watching seagulls fight over a chip.

Steve and I needed some late night beers after the footy. I
was dressed as "Wally" from the Where's Wally/Where's Waldo books. I
had a red and white striped shirt and a red and white striped wooly hat
on. The hat was knitted for me years earlier in Newcastle by Mum and
it wasn't just made of wool.. the white stripes on the skullcap part
were made of cat fur! In Newcastle we had a longhaired cat and when it
moulted in summer, Mum swept up lots of fur, boiled it in water to
clean it and then turned it into the white half of a red and white
hat. I literally have "The Cat in the Hat".

A lot of Australians give up reading after finishing "The Cat in the
Hat", but please give it another try. You'll get hours of enjoyment,
plus you get to find out why the third little Pig was building his
house out of brick.

The Cat that provided the fur was called Custer, it was a pale ginger
cat and I named it Custer as "The last of the palefaces". When Custer
was just a kitten he had the cute little meow that kittens have and
instead of saying "Meow" he actually said "Yee". Because of this, the
Cooper family have called cats yees ever since and any cat-related
word with an "ee" in the sound gets replaced by "yee" in the
sound. Example Cooper cat joke: Question What crime was the cat
burglar convicted of? Answer: Petty larcenyee. The big cats have
gotten in on the Yee action as well. What did the Snow Leopard say as
he fell off a ledge on the Himalayan mountain? Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!! I
once saw a grey yee sitting on a guy's shoulder, looking just like a
pirate's parrot. The cat said "Yeeces of Eight".

The first bar Steve and I tried for a drink wouldn't let us in.
We weren't drunk, the security guy just didn't like the way I looked,
dressed as Wally. I've often been refused entry to bars for being
flamboyantly dressed and security guys never like me although at least
I don't get in fights with them. Cricket fans will remember that David
Hookes got in a fight and got killed by a bouncer, and a few years
Phil Hughes also got killed by a bouncer.

I knew another bar that always let people in. It was near the Capitol
Theatre which is the main theatre for live musicals in Sydney. I saw
"Wicked" there and I also saw the Andrew Lloyd Webber
musical "Love Never Dies" which is the sequel to The Phantom of the
Opera. In Love Never Dies, Christine is now married to Raoul and they
have a child, a 7-year old boy. Everyone thinks the Phantom died in an
Opera House fire. But the Phantom resurfaces, he survived the fire and is
somehow less disfigured than before. He sings that years ago he and
Christine shared a night of passion together. He romanced her with a
candlelight dinner, with over a thousand candles ablaze in the Phantom's
underground lair.

This is actually why the Phantom had to demand money from the Opera
House managers every month, he had a lighting bill of roughly $4,000 a
month in today's terms. The way Australia is heading with "renewable"
energy and give-all-our-money-to-China Climate Change targets, we'll
all soon have a $4,000 a month lighting bill. If only Australia had
access to the world's largest supply of Uranium, we'd be able to do
something about that.

But back to "Love Never Dies" the Musical. The 7-year old boy is
musically and compositionally gifted. The audience starts to wonder
if Raoul or the Phantom is the father. It turns out that Raoul is
*not* the father and that means that 8 years earlier, Christine
underwent a Phantom pregnancy.

Opera Houses actually burn down pretty regularly. In Venice
Italy there's a famous Opera House Teatro la Fenice, the Phoenix,
which has burned down and been rebuilt three times already. In World
War 2 the Allies bombed German Opera Houses for sport. The Berlin
Opera house was levelled the day after a performance of the final
Wagner Ring Opera, Gotterdammerung, The Twilight of the Gods, which is
pretty appropriate when you think about it. You want an apocalypse?
Here's your apocalypse!!

Australian cricket all-rounder Keith Miller flew bombing raids with
Britain's Royal Air Force during World War 2. Miller was a
boys-own adventure hero who along with his cricket and war heroics
also played Aussie Rules to the highest level and loved horseracing,
wine, women and song and especially Classical Music. After one bombing
raid, Miller took an unauthorised detour over the German city of Bonn,
simply because that was Beethoven's birthplace. Miller refused to
accept that cricket was a dangerous game and said "That's not
pressure, pressure is a Messerschmidt up your arse".

In the Ninteen-Fifties my dad Mike Cooper played cricket
in a "New South Wales country vs Australia's Best" game; playing
against Keith Miller, Richie Benaud, Alan Davidson, Pete Philpott, Bob
Simpson and others. Dad was about the tenth best batsman in New South
Wales at the time but never acheived international honours. He once
told my Mum "Ruth, if it wasn't for you and the kids, I would've
played cricket for Australia". I like to think that Dad was right. He
was good friends with an Australian Test cricketer from Newcastle,
Jimmy de Courcy, who played three tests for Australia in England.

My brother Grahame was for years a gifted cricketer and I once
saw him smack a cover drive that was better than any that Kim Hughes
ever hit. Grahame played for junior NSW state
teams and once when batting he ran out Mark Waugh. It seemed for a
while that Mike Cooper's son might achieve Australian honours. But it
wasn't Mike Cooper's son who would became an Australian
representative, it was my son, Mike's grandson, who represented
his country. And Mike Cooper lived long enough to see it, and
Grahame drove me to Canberra for the ceremonies.

The woman most responsible for Linus making an Australian team was my
first wife Eu Lin. She did not live long enough to see it. She'd
died the previous year. She died of a rare agressive cancer with a
surival chance of fuck-all. She stayed with us for as long as she
could; every year then every month then every week then every day then
every hour.

It takes a while to get over these things. My favourite running gag in
Flying High/Airplane! isn't Surely you can't be serious/I am serious
and don't call me Shirley. My running gag is that the washed-up 
down-on-his-luck pilot Ted Striker is always remembering losing his
squadron in a bombing raid in World War 2. He tells anyone who'll
listen that he was shot down over Macho Grande. Over Macho Grande?
asks the listener. Striker shakes his head sadly and says "I don't
think I'll get over Macho Grande".

Life goes on, for the living, and the story now returns to my Porn
problem. Steve and I were easily admitted to the bar near the Capitol
Theatre. It's called the Chamberlain Hotel and is also called
The C Bar. It's in the Thai part of Sydney. Just as Sydney has a
Chinatown it now has a Thai Town or Thainatown.

Speaking of Chinatowns an American woman tourist in Hong Kong once
asked a Policeman where their Chinatown was. The policeman
replied, quite honestly, that Hong Kong doesn't have a Chinatown. The
tourist walked off disappointed. I hope she was able to find
some authentic Chinese restaurants and other Chinese experiences
during her stay in Hong Kong.

Inside the Chamberlain Hotel, Steve watched in amazement as I was
jumped on by three porn stars. They were Nattaporn, Kritaporn and
Sumattaporn. By the time we finsihed a second jug of beer, Kritaporn
was wearing the Cat in the Hat, Sumattaporn was wearing my Swans jersey
and Nattaporn was twerking me to the music of the live Thai band.

Porn stars were hard to find in those days, because this before
OnlyFans became popular. Today in 2025, OnlyFans is a great career
choice, and any 18-year-old girl can make $40,000 a month on the
platform. It's the biggest Internet goldrush since Online Poker!

Thai Pop music is so upbeat and cheerful that it makes Korean girl
bands in K-pop sound like Nick Cave covering Leonard Cohen. Yimmy
taught me a Thai pop song all about how a singer loves his girlfriend
even more than he loves eating Donuts. Here is the chorus: "Donut
tamisa miru. Pramen kir Do----nut".

Steve was looking out for me that night. He made sure that this was
all being recorded and sent me the videos afterwards. With his help, I
admitted my Porn problem and now had hard evidence to remind me that
when you want the perfect finish to a great night out, some beers and
dancing in a Thaitown bar is a great way to do it.
