These are unused jokes that I've deleted for space/time reasons
but I still think are pretty good jokes

(Kdramas)
They are sloooooow moving romances. By
Episode 3 the impossibly beautiful actress accidentally returns the
gaze of the young accountant and by Episode 17 the young man has
mustered up enough courage to tell the lady that she's dressed nicely
today. In Episode 40 the lady's high-school boyfriend has finished his
compulsory National Service and his reapparence in the lady's life
briefly threatens to increase the pace of the storytelling.

At the end of Episode 107, the South Korean President declares
Martial Law in an all-time cliff-hanger, but by the start of Episode
108, South Korea is a democracy again and everyone has forgotten that
there was a short period of Martial Law.
