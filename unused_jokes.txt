These are unused jokes that I've deleted for space/time reasons
but I still think are pretty good jokes

(Kdramas)
They are sloooooow moving romances. By
Episode 3 the impossibly beautiful actress accidentally returns the
gaze of the young accountant and by Episode 17 the young man has
mustered up enough courage to tell the lady that she's dressed nicely
today. In Episode 40 the lady's high-school boyfriend has finished his
compulsory National Service and his reapparence in the lady's life
briefly threatens to increase the pace of the storytelling.

At the end of Episode 107, the South Korean President declares
Martial Law in an all-time cliff-hanger, but by the start of Episode
108, South Korea is a democracy again and everyone has forgotten that
there was a short period of Martial Law.

(chinatown)
Speaking of Chinatowns an American woman tourist in Hong Kong once
asked a Policeman where their Chinatown was. The policeman
replied, quite honestly, that Hong Kong doesn't have a Chinatown. The
tourist walked off disappointed. I hope she was able to find
some authentic Chinese restaurants and other Chinese experiences
during her stay in Hong Kong.

(opera house bombings, cricket, over Mucho Grande)
Australian cricket all-rounder Keith Miller flew bombing raids with
Britain's Royal Air Force during World War 2. Miller was a
boys-own adventure hero who along with his cricket and war heroics
also played Aussie Rules to the highest level and loved horseracing,
wine, women and song and especially Classical Music. After one bombing
raid, Miller took an unauthorised detour over the German city of Bonn,
simply because that was Beethoven's birthplace. Miller refused to
accept that cricket was a dangerous game and said "That's not
pressure, pressure is a Messerschmidt up your arse".

In the Ninteen-Fifties my dad Mike Cooper played cricket
in a "New South Wales country vs Australia's Best" game; playing
against Keith Miller, Richie Benaud, Alan Davidson, Pete Philpott, Bob
Simpson and others. Dad was about the tenth best batsman in New South
Wales at the time but never acheived international honours. He once
told my Mum "Ruth, if it wasn't for you and the kids, I would've
played cricket for Australia". I like to think that Dad was right. He
was good friends with an Australian Test cricketer from Newcastle,
Jimmy de Courcy, who played three tests for Australia in England.

My brother Grahame was for years a gifted cricketer and I once
saw him smack a cover drive that was better than any that Kim Hughes
ever hit. Grahame played for junior NSW state
teams and once when batting he ran out Mark Waugh. It seemed for a
while that Mike Cooper's son might achieve Australian honours. But it
wasn't Mike Cooper's son who would became an Australian
representative, it was my son, Mike's grandson, who represented
his country. And Mike Cooper lived long enough to see it, and
Grahame drove me to Canberra for the ceremonies.

The woman most responsible for Linus making an Australian team was my
first wife Eu Lin. She did not live long enough to see it. She'd
died the previous year. She died of a rare agressive cancer with a
surival chance of fuck-all. She stayed with us for as long as she
could; every year then every month then every week then every day then
every hour.

It takes a while to get over these things. I want to tell you my
favourite running gag from the great comedy movie Flying High!
or Airplane! What is it? Well a running gag is a short joke that's
repeated several times in the movie, but that's not important right
now. A lot of people like Surely you can't be serious?/I am serious
and don't call me Shirley. My running gag is that the washed-up
down-on-his-luck ex-World-War-2 pilot Ted Striker can't fly planes
anymore. He is always obsessed by being the only surivovr of his
squadron after he got shot down in a bombing raid. He tells anyone
who'll listen that he was shot down over Macho Grande. Over Macho
Grande? asks the listener. Striker shakes his head sadly and says "I
don't think I'll *ever* get over Macho Grande".

Life goes on, for the living, and
