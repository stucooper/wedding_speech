Who mum rang up every weekend and swapped Cryptic Crossword answers with.
I'm sure it cheered Col up but what sort of idiot rings up old women
every weekend with nothing better to do than trade crossword answers??

Talk to some of the IT Computer Scientists here or just listen
to their conversations. It's like watching an episode of the Big Bang
Theory, if the Big Bang Theory was actually funny. I think the Big Bang
Theory has done more damage to the image of scientists than
COVID-19 and Global Warming put together.

I have an IQ of 1600 and *I* can't even understand what you expected from
that relationship"

I'm not a House man or House husband... the only house thing I'm
good is early 1990s UK and European House Music thanks to my
brother Craig. I know all about C&C Music Factory, Yazz, S-Express and
La Bouche. Like the BBC TV historian Philomena Cunk I relate a lot of
historical events to Technotronic's "Punp up the Jam". Mark Reay and I
once drove a removal truck from Gosford to Coffs Harbour and it had a
tiptronic transmission system and for most of the time I was driving I
was telling Mark that "this gear is.. this gear is.. this gear
is.. tiptronic".

I'm genuinely funny. When you tell bad jokes people say "don't give
up your day job" but my friends kept saying "DO give up your day job".
So I did, and it's made me the success that I am today.

I don't want to be a grumpy-old-man but it seems to me that
OnlyFans women are competeting with each other in a race to the bottom
to plumb new depths of skankery.

Actress Denise Richards's daughter got on OnlyFans
so to help her feel supported in this excellent life decision, Mum
joined the platform as well. Don't do it, Denise, you don't need
the money. You are cheapening my memories of your performances in
Starship Troopers and as James Bond girl Doctor Christmas Jones in
The World is Not Enough. I thought Christmas only came once a
year. Denise Richards also starred in a 2021 teenage movie all about
extreme watersports; waterskiing and kiteboarding. I've only seen the
trailer but this could be the best young-adult action movie of all
time, better even than BMX Bandits starring Nicole Kidmam. The Denise
Richards kiteboarding movie is called... Send it!

The two biggest skanks on OnlyFans, in a pretty crowded field, are
Lily Phillips and Bonnie Blue.

Both Lily and Bonnie showed off ultrasound photos and baby bumps, but
they were both phantom pregnancies and this time the Phantom of the
Opera was nowhere to be seen. They're in skanky compeition with each
other to break the record for the most number of men slept with in a
single day. It's a 24-hour test of endurance, it's the skank's version
of Le Mans.

Lily Phillips said she slept with 100 men in a day and I saw a video
on online news. There was a half open bedroom door and a queue of
fully-dressed men in their twenties waiting for their turn to go
in. The queue went down the corridor, around the corner, down the
stairs and spilled out onto the street. There were also fully-dressed
women in the queue so I double-checked what I was watching. It wasn't
Lily Phillips, I'd clicked on the wrong video. It was a two-bedroom
unit in Coogee that was open for inspection and could be rented at
only $1,350 a week. One of the Estate Agents was walking up and down
the queue and was telling people that even though the asking price was
just $1,350 a week, they were allowed to ring up the agency and offer
more. Housing crisis? What housing crisis??!!??

Meanwhile, Bonnie Blue was planning her own skanky stunt in
Queensland's Gold Coast. She planned a marathon sex session with horny
young teenagers at the "Schoolies" celebrations in November. All the
guys would need to sign consent forms; it was a great chance for the
young men to learn all about Informed Consent and Respectful
Relationships.

The Australian Government got wind of this and they cancelled Bonnie's
Tourist Visa, on the grounds that because she was going to film the
sex and sell it on OnlyFans, she wasn't coming as a tourist. She
rang up the government to appeal the Visa cancellation. The man she
spoke to confirmed the cancellation, and said "Bonnie Blue. Bonnie
Blue, just doin' the do, and you are through. And there's nothing you
can do". HI CRAIG!!!!!!!!

I won't keep saying "skank,skank,skank", because if I do an ATM will
fall on my head and crush me to death. Breaking Bad. Here's a
great Daily Telegraph headline. Australian Police once busted a
Meth lab and the criminals had dangerous animals in the lab including
a large python which was by now a drug-affected python from the
fumes in the lab. The front page of the Daily Telegraph said SNAKING
BAD. There was a small picture of the python with it's tongue out,
that had the caption: METH ADDER. My favourite headline from the Tele
came after Tasmanian Senator Jacquie Lambie did a radio interview and
said that she needed a boyfriend and she needed her new man to be
packing it downstairs, if you know what I mean. The front page of the
Daily Telegraph the morning after said SENATOR LAMBIE CASTS DONKEY VOTE.
