Chapter 3: YIMMY TO THE RESCUE
------------------------------

It's now time for Yimmy to come fully into the story.

Yimmy was born in Thailand, a few years after I was born in
Newcastle. Like my half-Norwegian/half-English high school girl;
Yimmy is also mixed-race. Yimmy's Dad is Chinese. Her Mum was
Thai. That makes Yimmy (pause) Chai.

You can imagine what it's like in a coffee shop. I have a long black
Espresso Coffee, and Yimmy also has a long black, although if it's a really
hot day she'll have iced long black coffee; a freezing cold drink served
in a big clear plastic cup. As well as freezing cold coffees, Yimmy
likes freezing cold showers. I don't know if this is just a Thai thing
or a Yimmy thing. Moo Deng has warmer showers in the zoo than Yimmy does.

Some couples fight over the TV remote, Yimmy and I fight over the hot
tap in the shower. I actually like it to be turned on. Yimmy and I
often shower together and it's a very nice shower let me tell you;
I'm up with my hands against the wall, Yimmy cleans me, then I get out
and Yimmy is finally allowed to turn the hot tap off and finish her
own shower.

The tap's come off a few times, I might leave it off and just leave
some hot water coming out of the shower twenty-four/seven. It would
send my water bill through the roof, but at least Yimmy wouldn't be
able to have freezing showers anymore, and she'd get used to hot
showers soon enough.

Yimmy and I met in a bar in Newtown. It was one of those bars in
Sydney that has a sign on the bar with arrows pointing left and
right. One arrow says NO SERVICE AREA and the other arrow says
POOR SERVICE AREA. After chatting to Yimmy for a while, it was my turn
to get the drinks, and just 40 minutes and 38 dollars later, I came
back to Yimmy carrying two schooners of tap beer.

They need one of those signs for the downstairs bar on the nights that
you're not working, Cooper. You are so much better at pouring
drinks and telling customers the monthly member's specials than anyone
else in this club. I once had a very pretty Asian bartender pour me
the worst beer in history; the top 80% of it was head. It was my own
stupid fault, I'd just watched a James Bond film and I thought it
would be cool to order my beer "shaken, not stirred".

Yimmy lived in Ashfield when we met, so we caught the same train
home. Now you'd think Newtown to Flemington all stops including
Ashfield would be a nice easy trip on a Friday night 11pm but if you
think that then you really don't know Sydney trains. The train was
doing the 40 minutes between stops trick. We seriously considered
getting off at Stanmore, then we thought about getting off at
Petersham, Lewisham and Summer Hill. Yimmy got off at Ashfield and
by the time the train reached Flemington the sun had been up for an
hour and I was able to buy my Saturday morning newspaper.

Inner West Sydney trains are so shit that many years ago The Daily
Telegraph newspaper arranged in my opinion the greatest newspaper
stunt of all time. They got Australian Marathon champ and City to Surf
legend Steve Moneghetti to catch an Inner West all-stations morning
train from Burwood to Central. Moneghetti, dressed in his running
gear, got off the train at Summer Hill and ran towards the city on
public streets, stopping for traffic as required. He ran past
Lewisham, Petersham, Stanmore and then got to Newtown and went
into Newtown train station. Ten seconds later, Moneghetti got back on
the all-stops train to Central. Not just any all-stops train to
Central but the EXACT SAME TRAIN that he'd got off at Summer Hill.

Steve Moneghetti still holds the all-time record for the City to Surf,
Forty Minutes Three Seconds. He had seven major wins in his running
career. He won the Tokyo Marathon once, the Commonwealth Games
Marathon once, and the City to Surf four times, sponsored by the Sun
Herald. His final race win was the all-stops Summer Hill to Newtown
race; sponsored by the RTBU; the Rail, Tram and Bus Union.

So back to Yimmy and I that Friday night, trying to get from Newtown
to Ashfield to Flemington. It's a good early test of a relationship
sharing a four-hour night-time train trip that should have take
fourteen minutes. By the time we got to Lewisham I'd told Yimmy about
my family, my job, my favourite movies and the last five books
that I'd read. After an hour I said "my voice needs a break, Yimmy,
I've been talking about myself for the last hour. Why don't you talk
about me for a while?"

By the time we reached Summer Hill we were already living together and
by Ashfield we'd booked the Wedding Registry and Club Parramatta for
Thursday 3rd April 2025. It's amazing what you can do on mobile phones
these days, especially when you're stuck in a train.

There's another good test for people in a relationship that can
help them find out if they're compatible enough for a long term
relationship. That is to go to IKEA and walk through all the rooms;
that is enough to strain *any* relationship. Just before the Covid
restrictions in Sydney got too severe, there was a Covid outbreak from
IKEA in Sydnenham. Analysis showed that the person who spread COVID
there had been in that IKEA for a continuous ten hours, and that
meant that the COVID super-spreader was either a staff member or one
of the customers. It could've been any of the customers, except for a
lady from Hurstville who went straight to the returns desk and was
only in Sydenham IKEA for six hours.

Yimmy moved in with me after a few weeks, and our place in Flemington
wasn't so clean in those days. There were dirty dishes in the sink,
clothes strewn on the floor and Linus had left unsolved equations all
over the house. There was a two-litre bottle of Cottage
Cheese in the fridge and I thought "hang on, they don't sell
Cottage Cheese in bottles." I checked the label on the bottle and it
said "Full Cream Milk". It was totally rank, it was like some kind of
dairy kombucha. It took us about a week to finally eat it all.

Yimmy soon started cracking the whip and once she finished doing that
she started enforcing some standards of discipline and behaviour in
our home life. When she arrived, there were three thousand and thirty
books in the house. I'm not making this number up, I have all my books
catalogued in text files in a github project and a shell script counts
the books and six months ago I had three thousand and thirty
books. With Yimmy's help I undertook a massive cull of my book
collection and today I only have three thousand and sixteen books.

Things got serious with Yimmy pretty quickly. When your relationship
has been going for a while you start to think to yourself "She's a
Keeper" but I thought to myself "She's a Cooper". Yimmy had to pass a
severe initiation test, a week-long visit to Tasmania to meet my Mum
and my brother Craig, this is a test she passed with flying
colours. My Mum now needs someone home with her at all times; so Yimmy
was able to sit with Mum and give Craig an afternoon off with his
brother.

Grahame said that when Linus was born it was because I had been
"Re-cooperating". That's very good, Grahame, not quite an all-time
zinger like "Re-membered" but still very strong. When a mummy
cat gives birth, the owner pats the mother cat and says "Happy New
Yee".

Yimmy works in Thai massage. It's back-breaking work, so if you ever
want to get your back broken, go and see Yimmy. Yimmy joined me at a
mega-secondhand-booksale in Canberra and she bought a lot of books on
massage and anatomy. She now has detailed files on Anatomy for the
same reason that the Terminator has them; it makes her a more
efficient killing machine. Just last week Yimmy found a new pain
pressure point on my body that we didn't know about before. I was
impressed by Yimmy's dedication; she already had 57 pain points on my
body but now she has 58 and she's still searching out new ones.

I do feel wonderful after Yimmy's massages but it might be like the
madman who bashes his own head against a wall every ten seconds.
A policeman came and said "why do you keep bashing your head against
the wall?" and the madman said "because it feels fantastic when I
stop".

Yimmy has a strong accent and it took a while for me to understand
a lot of what she says. She pronounces "Aussies" and "Horsies" the same
way so I sometimes get excited that she wants a trip to Royal Randwick
when she's actually talking about an event that will have a lot of
Westerners present.

Yimmy asked me once why I had to watch every single horserace on a
Saturday. I told her there are people who watch every horserace
and report if they see anything suspicious; they're called
Racing Stuarts. Racing is open to corruption and the Stuarts keep a
very close eye on things. In my opinion, as a Racing Stuart,
some horseracing is rigged in Australia, they even admit to it.
I have a TAB betting ticket and it says $10 times 2.70 Fixed Odds.
So even the TAB are now admitting that it's all fixed.
