Chapter 3: YIMMY TO THE RESCUE
------------------------------

It's now time for Yimmy to come into the story. I'll share with you
some fun stories about our first dates and our life together so far.

Yimmy and I met in a bar in Newtown. It was one of those bars in
Sydney that has a sign on the bar with arrows pointing left and
right. One arrow says NO SERVICE AREA and the other arrow says
POOR SERVICE AREA. After chatting to Yimmy for a while, it was my turn
to get the drinks, and just 40 minutes and 38 dollars later, I came
back to Yimmy carrying two schooners of tap beer.

They need one of those signs for the downstairs bar on the nights that
you're not working, Cooper. You are slightly better at pouring
drinks and telling customers the monthly member's specials than anyone
else in this club. I once had a very pretty Asian bartender pour me
the worst beer in history; the top 80% of it was head. It was my own
stupid fault, I'd just watched a James Bond film and I thought it
would be cool to order my beer "shaken, not stirred".

Yimmy lived in Ashfield at the time, so we caught the same train
home. Now you'd think Newtown to Flemington all stops including
Ashfield would be a nice easy trip on a Friday night 11pm but if you
think that then you really don't know Sydney trains. The train was
doing the 40 minutes between stops trick. We seriously considered
getting off at Stanmore, then we thought about getting off at
Petersham, WallyLewisham and Summer Hill. Yimmy got off at Ashfield and
by the time the train reached Flemington the sun had been up for an
hour and I was able to buy my Saturday morning newspaper.

Inner West Sydney trains are so bad that a few years ago The Daily
Telegraph newspaper arranged possibly the world's best-ever newspaper
stunt. They got Australian Marathon champ and City to Surf legend
Steve Moneghetti to catch the Inner West all-stations morning
train. Moneghetti, dressed in his running gear, got off the train at
Summer Hill and ran towards the city on public streets. He ran past
WallyLewisham, Petersham, Stanmore and then got to Newtown and 
went into Newtown train station. Two minutes later, Moneghetti got
back on the train. Not just any train.. but the EXACT SAME TRAIN that
he'd left at Summer Hill.

It's a good early test of a relationship sharing a four-hour night
time train trip that should have taken fourteen minutes. By the time
we got to WallyLewisham I'd told Yimmy about my family, my job, my
favourite movies and the last five fiction books that I'd read. After
an hour I said "my voice needs a break, Yimmy, I've been talking about
myself for the last hour. Why don't you talk about me for a while?"

By the time we reached Summer Hill we were already living together and
by Ashfield we'd booked the Wedding Registry for Thursday 3rd April
2025. It's amazing what you can do on mobile phones these days,
especially when you're stuck in a train.
