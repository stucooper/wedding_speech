Chapter 3: YIMMY TO THE RESCUE
------------------------------

It's now time for Yimmy to come fully into the story.

Yimmy was born in Thailand, a few years after I was born in
Newcastle. Like my half-Norwegian/half-English high school girl;
Yimmy is also mixed-race. Yimmy's Dad is Chinese. Her Mum was
Thai. That makes Yimmy (pause) Chai.

You can imagine what it's like in a coffee shop. I have a long black
Espresso Coffee, and Yimmy also has a long black, although if it's a really
hot day she'll have iced long black coffee; a freezing cold drink served
in a big clear plastic cup. As well as freezing cold coffees, Yimmy
likes freezing cold showers. I don't know if this is just a Thai thing
or a Yimmy thing. Moo Deng has warmer showers in the zoo than Yimmy does.

Some couples fight over the TV remote, Yimmy and I fight over the hot
tap in the shower. I actually like it to be turned on. Yimmy and I
often shower together and it's a very nice shower let me tell you;
I'm up with my hands against the wall, Yimmy cleans me, then I get out
and Yimmy is finally allowed to turn the hot tap off and finish her
own shower.

The tap's come off a few times, I might leave it off and just leave
some hot water coming out of the shower twenty-four/seven. It would
send my water bill through the roof, but at least Yimmy wouldn't be
able to have freezing showers anymore, and she'd get used to hot
showers soon enough.

Yimmy and I met in a bar in Newtown. It was one of those bars in
Sydney that has a sign on the bar with arrows pointing left and
right. One arrow says NO SERVICE AREA and the other arrow says
POOR SERVICE AREA. After chatting to Yimmy for a while, it was my turn
to get the drinks, and just 40 minutes and 38 dollars later, I came
back to Yimmy carrying two schooners of tap beer.

They need one of those signs for the downstairs bar on the nights that
you're not working, Cooper. You are so much better at pouring
drinks and telling customers the monthly member's specials than anyone
else in this club. I once had a very pretty Asian bartender pour me
the worst beer in history; the top 80% of it was head. It was my own
stupid fault, I'd just watched a James Bond film and I thought it
would be cool to order my beer "shaken, not stirred".

Yimmy lived in Ashfield at the time, so we caught the same train
home. Now you'd think Newtown to Flemington all stops including
Ashfield would be a nice easy trip on a Friday night 11pm but if you
think that then you really don't know Sydney trains. The train was
doing the 40 minutes between stops trick. We seriously considered
getting off at Stanmore, then we thought about getting off at
Petersham, WallyLewisham and Summer Hill. Yimmy got off at Ashfield and
by the time the train reached Flemington the sun had been up for an
hour and I was able to buy my Saturday morning newspaper.

Inner West Sydney trains are so shit that a few years ago The Daily
Telegraph newspaper arranged in my opinion the greatest newspaper
stunt of all time. They got Australian Marathon champ and City to Surf
legend Steve Moneghetti to catch an Inner West all-stations morning
train from Burwood to Central. Moneghetti, dressed in his running
gear, got off the train at Summer Hill and ran towards the city on
public streets, stopping for traffic as required. He ran past
WallyLewisham, Petersham, Stanmore and then got to Newtown and went
into Newtown train station. Ten seconds later, Moneghetti got back on
the all-stops train to Central. Not just any all-stops train to
Central but the EXACT SAME TRAIN that he'd got off at Summer Hill.

It's a good early test of a relationship sharing a four-hour night
time train trip that should have taken fourteen minutes. By the time
we got to WallyLewisham I'd told Yimmy about my family, my job, my
favourite movies and the last five fiction books that I'd read. After
an hour I said "my voice needs a break, Yimmy, I've been talking about
myself for the last hour. Why don't you talk about me for a while?"

By the time we reached Summer Hill we were already living together and
by Ashfield we'd booked the Wedding Registry and Club Parramatta for
Thursday 3rd April 2025. It's amazing what you can do on mobile phones
these days, especially when you're stuck in a train.

There's another good test for people in a relationship that can
help them find out if they're compatible enough for a long term
relationship. That is to go to IKEA and walk through all the rooms;
that is enough to strain *any* relationship. Just before the Covid
restrictions in Sydney got too severe, there was a Covid outbreak from
IKEA in Sydnenham. Analysis showed that the person who spread COVID
there had been in that IKEA for a continuous 10 hours, but they
couldn't tell if the COVID spreader was a staff member or any of the
customers.

Yimmy has a strong accent and it took a while for me to understand
a lot of what she says. She pronounces "Aussies" and "Horsies" the same
way so I sometimes get excited that she wants a trip to Randwick when
she's actually talking about an event that will have a lot of
Westerners present.
