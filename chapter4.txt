Chapter 4: THANK THE GUESTS

Everyone here tonight is special and I'm going to thank you all for
coming. Not collectively, but individually.

################

MARIO COMPTANGELO is my mechanic. Since I drive
30-year-old manual cars, I need a quality mechanic who can tune my
vehicle to meet my exacting performance demands. My car spends more
time in Mario's workshop than in my garage. Actually my car spends more
time in Mario's workshop than *Mario* spends in his workshop.

Mario has met Yimmy a few times during drop offs and pick ups.

Behind his back, I call him Mario Castel Sant'Angelo. The
Castel Sant'Angelo is the army barracks in Rome that Tosca jumps off
at the end of the magnificent opera by Giacomo Puccini.

Quickly on Opera, Puccini also wrote the great Opera Madam Butterfly,
about the American Navy sailor in Nagasaki who marries a teenage
Japanese girl on a month-by-month marriage; a joke to him but deadly
serious to the wife. I love to watch Madam Butterfly because I get to
see a Westerner treat Asian women even worse than I do.

Like me, Mario was married to a Singaporean Chinese lady who is no
longer with us. Mario has a half-Thai grandson and taught me an
important Thai word: "Jup", which means "Kiss me immediately".

Thank you, Mario.
################

STEVE CROWE is an old friend from my Newcastle days going back to High
School. Steve was in the year below mine and was in complete awe of my
academic prowess. He was a fantastic cricketer in those days and I
used to wonder why someone a year younger than me was playing in
higher grades of cricket than I was, it didn't seem fair.

Steve held fantastic State of Origin parties at his house back in the
day. Steve has strong interests in both Accountancy and Turf
Accountancy.

A few months ago Steve told me he was getting a Brazilian which had me
amazed. Does that even make sense for guys? I shaved "down there"
myself years ago... verrrry carefully. It didn't work for me but I've
seen tonight that it's working a lot better for Steve.

Thank you, Steve.
################

MICHAEL TILL is an IT buddy, a sports buddy and a drinking buddy.
He has German heritage and he taught me the correct pronunciation of
the German beer you call Lowenbrau but we call Lervenbroi. Michael is
here with his plus-one Natalie and I need to talk to her for a
minute.

Natalie, Michael is a fantastic guy. You already
know that, but with Michael Till you have to be careful with
the PDAs, the Public Displays of Affection. Even just walking down the
street holding hands is dangerous. That's because it's
really bad for your career if someone catches you with your hand in
The Till.

There's just enough older people here tonight to appreciate that joke
but because nobody uses cash anymore I'll have to retire the "hand in
the Till" joke. Mike, I'll ring you up in a few weeks and see if we
can't change your name to Michael Tap-and-Go, so that next time I can
warn Natalie not to get caught with her hand in the Tap-and-Go.

Michael I was going to poke a bit of good natured fun at you but
I can't. I just can't. We all heard about what happened to Triple-M
host Marty Sheargold when he made fun of Australian woman's soccer.
He lost his job and he lost it quick smart. Now this is a private
function, but anyone can get recorded on a mobile phone these days, so
I still need to be very careful what I say. So let me say this:
"I love the Tillies. The Tillies are my favourite International team.
Women's sport is so important to me, and especially Women's Soccer
which should really be called Women's Football. We should build a
statue of the Tillies, they came fourth. The Tillies are so
inspirational."

Everyone is so quick to take offence these days. It's turning up in
films. There's a new Batman film in production where the Caped
Crusader gets in trouble for not being aware of social justice and
diversity issues. His enemy in the film is called "The Woker". Batman
tries to fight The Woker after being accused of Cultural
Appropriation. He stole imagery and ideas from the Bat community, and
the only thing we're allowed to steal from Bats is the Coronavirus.

They fight, but the Woker wins because Batman forgets
to check his privilege and when you live in Stately Wayne Manor you
have a lot of privilege and unconscious bias. The Woker reports Batman
to HR. In a mediation meeting, The Woker is offended when Batman talks
to him, and he accuses the Caped Crusader of "Batsplaining".

In the climax of the film, Batman is brought before the full
Justice League. Batman tells them that his pronouns are "Bat" and
"Bat". Christopher Nolan directs and says it's a complicated
story but it will still make a lot more sense than "Tenet".

Thank you, Michael and Natalie.
################

DEAN TAYLOR is a man of multiple talents. I worked with Dean in the
late 1990s but after the first "Dot Com" crash, Dean escaped from IT
and now works in teaching. Dean's a Mensa member and is involved in
athletics. Dean is an excellent trivia player and pop music enthusiast
with a focus on early David Bowie. Dean lives close to the Star
Casino, and once a year Dean and I get together to watch the first TV
movie of the New Year, The Village People origin story "Can't stop the
Music".

Thank you, Dean.
################

LLANLEY CROWDER is my oldest friend that I met through playing
poker. Away from the tables, Llanley's an expert in sports science and
athletics performance. He actually knows Dean Taylor through
athletics, independently from me.

Llanley is a gun driver and before the Covid crisis we used to have a
few Canberra trips together. These Canberra trips were such fun that
we were considering a Perth to Sydney drive, although from the look of
things it's mostly empty desert with no other cars on the road and the
Spotto score would be very low.

Many years ago when I was down in the dumps, Llanley invited me to his
house at short notice on New Year's Eve. We drank nothing stronger
than Pepsi Max all night, but it was one of the great New Year's Eves.

Thank you, Llanley.
################

SIMON REA is my other guest tonight who I met through poker. I've
known Simon for that long that when I first met him, he didn't even
have a driver's license! Simon and his son Aiden joined Yimmy and I on
one of our first dates, which was to Olympic Park to attend a GWS game
at the small stadium there. Somehow I'd got some extra free tickets,
and free tickets to a GWS game are as rare as hens.

Simon and I make a trip together to Engadine four times a year, to
play a day-long Saturday poker tournament there and also to see just
what Scott Morrison did at the McDonalds there.

Simon works in IT Sales which means that every time I call him on his
mobile phone, he doesn't answer. A mutual friend once asked me
for Simon's number and I said "I'll give it to you but it's not good
for much". A week later my mate said "Yeah I shouldn't have bothered
getting it from you".

Simon loses his phone two or three times a year in taxis, Ubers or
even family picnics. He doesn't know about it for a week afterwards
and his friends don't know about it for months.

If everyone who played poker was of the quality and character of
Llanley Crowder and Simon Rea, poker would be much more highly regarded.

Thank you, Simon.
################

BRIAN KIM is someone who loves Aussie Rules Football almost as much
as the Australians do. We've watched games at the Sydney Cricket
Ground, Sydney Olympic Park and Manuka Oval, Canberra.

I met Brian at a Chatswood performance of the adult Sesame Street
humans-and-puppets Musical, "Avenue Q", by Gilbert and Sullivan.
Avenue Q features the musical standards "The Internet is for Porn" and
"You can be as loud as the hell you want, when you're making love". I
won't sing these for you right now, look them up on YouTube later.

After Avenue Q finished, I drove Brian home using Sydney's best
street, The Commenarra Parkway; including the West Pymble Yanko Road
Suicide Dip. If they ever put speed cameras on the Commenarra Parkway,
I'll lose my licence within a month. And if Yimmy doesn't start
wearing her seatbelt over her shoulder properly, I'll also lose my
licence within a month. Thanks, Big Tech!!

Brian divides his time between Canberra and Sydney, and we've done a
lot of driving on the Federal Highway together. Because he's of Korean
heritage, Brian learned US-focussed English not Aussie-English so
he calls me Stoo not Stew. Brian is now the only one of my friends
who does that.

Thank you, Brian.
################

NICK URBANIK is my oldest IT friend from Optus. Nick and I are from
parallel universes. We both married Asiam women and we both fathered a
single child named Linus. Nick's son is Linus Urbanik. As you can
hear the pronunciation is different; but Nick can pronounce it his way
and I'll pronounce it the correct way.

Nick and I both owned a complete set of the O'Reilly books, although
last year Nick divested himself of unneeded books to the extent that I
now own two complete sets of the O'Reilly books. Nick studied IT at
University of New South Wales under professors including
John Lions who wrote the commentaries on the Unix V6 source code.

Nick is an enthusiastic bike rider and enjoys the physical sport of
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

Thank you, Nick.
################

VIJESH SHETTY is the latest in a long line of IT associates to be
dazzled by my humour and skill. Competitive by nature, Vijesh assumed
the mantle of the King of Car A after I left our company a few years
ago.

Vijesh is a champion of data centres and could easily lift and rack
heavy computers which we drove from Crown Barangaroo to
Exchanges in the Stuber car. RAID Hard drives would fail themselves
during his support week so that he could Return-to-Manufacturer them
to Fujitsu Technicians.

Vijesh and I were once at a data centre and his work was taking much
longer than expected. I'd done my bit and Vijesh encouraged me to go
home; he could get a taxi once he was done and the company would pay
for it. I stuck around an extra 40 minutes, because Vijesh is a dad
and his wife and young child were waiting at home for him. And a young
mum and child don't wait an extra ten minutes for Daddy to get home at
night. Not when I can do something about it.

Thank you, Vijesh.
################

ETHANN CASTELL is fun in human form. We met during the dot com crash
at an IBM learn to use Linux seminar. Ethann was impressed that I'd
already installed games on my seminar laptop and was at stage 2 of
the fish eating skiing game, Tux Racer. He introduced me to a business
friend of his, Greg Hickman, who gave me a Linux programming and
administration job at a time when any IT job was hard to find.

Ethann originates from New Zealand and before moving to the West
Island, he had a strong interest in Rugby Union and horseracing,
particularly trotting. Ethann is a champion pinball player; it pains
me to have to admit that but after our last pinball trip to Newcastle
I had to slink off with my tail between my legs and concede his
manifest superiority.

Ethann once watched the awesome Oppenheimer film with me in bed, and
the earth moved for both of us.

I've never been one for buck's parties but Ethann insisted on a buck's
party which was tricky to do as he came down from Queensland for a
Thursday ceremony. Since there was midweek racing at Warwick Farm, we
went there yesterday and I put on my last ever losing horseracing bets
as a single man.

Thank you, Ethann.
################

CHARLES CAVE was my first manager in my first IT job in Sydney way
back in 1993. He says he gave me the job because I turned up to the
interview in Chatswood with three specialised classical music CDs I
had just bought, performances by the greatest Soviet pianist of the
20th century, Sviatoslav Richter.

Charles is a highly cultured man with interests in reading,
photography, Asia, Languages, Visual Art and Classical Music.
He works with me on our on-again, on-again podcast which we call "From
Bayreuth to Baywatch: The podcast of High Culture, Low Culture and
Everything in Between".

Thank you, Charles.
################

ANTHONY CORRENTE was hired by Charles Cave two years after he hired
me, continuing Charles's record of employing absolute winners.
Anthony was my best man for my first marriage in 1998. He
was one of Eu Lin's best friends and he is also one of Linus's.

Tonight is the first time for Anthony to meet Yimmy and I'm sorry it's
taken this long Anthony but there's not much reason to go to the Hills
District these days.

Anthony broke his foot recently in what must have been a straight red
card for the defender. He's hauled himself off his deathbed to be with
us today and that's a great effort.

Anthony is one of those Italian Stallion drivers who can get to the
Sydney Football Stadium from anywhere else in Sydney in under 20
minutes, by using back streets of Five Dock and Leichardt known only
to true Italians. It was on one of these football trips to watch Sydney
FC, known to their fans as "The C", that Anthony changed my life. He
insisted that I play a car game that I'd never heard of before. I
thought the game was pretty stupid, but the third or fourth time I
played it started to get a little bit fun. Soon I found myself happily
shouting out the name of the game, Spotto.

Thank you, Anthony.
################

JAMES PONZA is the most naturally gifted Spotto player of his
generation. He is also sensational at IT, especially in the Optus
environment, cryptic crosswords, English language puns and has a
knowledge of classic Doctor Who that surpasses even mine.

James is also getting married in just a few months time and he's
understandably a bit nervous now that he's seen what a real man's
wedding speech looks like. You're on, kid. And it's a hard act to
follow.

Years ago James and I went on a weight-loss program, which involved
the Keto diet and 16 kilometre daily walks. My keto chef thought the
weight loss was entirely due to Keto but I can't help thinking that 96
kilometres a week of walking also had something to do with it.

It was my first time trying to lose weight and I used to understate my
true weight by three kilograms. If the scales said 108 kilograms I
reported 105 kilograms. James said that was cheating, but I told him
that this was my first ever time trying to lose weight. I was an
Apprentice at weight-loss, and as Ethann, Steve and Grahame know full
well, Apprentices can claim. If I ever try weight loss a second time,
I'll be allowed to understate my weight by 1.5 kilos. The third time
I get a 1 kilo allowance and after that I have to ride at my true
weight.

Our morning walks took in Centennial Park, Randwick racecourse, UNSW,
Coogee Bay Road then the Coogee to Bondi beach walk, after which we'd
get a coffee at the Depot and then get the Bondi to City bus back to
the car on Oxford Street, getting off a few stops early so that James
could shake me awake and we could walk one final effing kilometre.

Every morning, we passed Tamarama surf club and there was one
last hill before we'd see Bondi. James was now 2 metres in front of me
and my legs were aching. In scorching heat I traced my mate's
steps, till all hope was out of reach. When I topped the rise, wiped
my eyes, and found the legend that became a beach.

James called Spottos on the other side of the beach, two kilometres
away. He was never wrong and the morning Spotto score was typically 25
to 8. James actually thought that I'd invented Spotto, and when he
found out about it on the Internet much later he told me "You never
invented Spotto!!" and I said "of course not, I never said that I
did!!".

What sort of fool thinks that I invented Spotto? Everyone knows that
Anthony Corrente invented it.

James has driven my car a few times, in the Macquarie Centre near
Optus, but the driving tester keeps failing him or failing the car.

Late last year James rejoined Optus and now works with Nick Urbanik.
in a highly specialised Optus team, Section 31.

Thank you, James.
################

MARK REAY is my best man for this ceremony. He lost his partner Louise
last year so I welcomed him to a club that does not welcome new
members; the club of men who lost their partners way too young.

As you can see Mark, it's taken me years to get over the loss of
my wife and I can tell you it will take you a long time as well.
At times, I said that I don't think I'll ever get over Macho Grande.

Before Louise's sudden passing, Mark, Louise, Yimmy and I went on a
few double dates. Louise had planned a Yellow Party in Mark's place at
Urunga near Coffs Harbour for the start of 2025. It's a few months
late, it's in a different city, the colour scheme is different and not
everybody can make it tonight, but I'm sure you've enjoyed tonight's
Yellow Party, Mark.

Mark's a keen music fan although he hated New Order and especially
their compilcation album and I thought to myself that Mark was a real
Substance Abuser. Mark works in possibly the highest pressure and most
challenging part of Optus. We're in close contact several times a week
and I like to think that along with providing him with emotional
support, I also give him a little tech support along the way.

Thank you, Mark.
################

CATHY PAN is Linus's closest friend. She disguised herself as one of
Yimmy's Bridesmaids, but I knew it was her. Cathy helped Eu Lin during
her desperate final months and she continues to help Linus, Yimmy and
I to this day.

Cathy has helped us with shopping and cooking and housework here and
there, and often I'm in the house at the same time as her and Linus is
still sleeping. I'm able to startle Cathy from a distance of 10 metres
simply by saying hi to her.

Some people have friends so close that they are honorary "aunts,
uncles, brothers or sisters" of the family. Cathy is an honorary
Cooper sister.

Thank you, Cathy.
################

GRAHAME COOPER has been my older brother for as long as I can
remember. He was a hugely attractive figure to me when I was a
kid. It wasn't just me that found Grahame attractive either; his
levels of charisma in the 1980s and 1990s were matched only by Bob
Hawke.

Grahame is here tonight with his girlfriend Kel, and Kel has recently
become a GOLF ... player. I hope I got the vowel in that word right,
Grahame. Grahame's good at golf too, Kel. Grahame you don't need me to
tell you that the most important skill in Golf is putting. Drive for
show, putt for dough as the tour players say. So work on your
putting. Just keep putting it, putting it, putting it into the hole.

Grahame wasn't able to come to my first wedding; he and his then wife
were stuck managaging a pub in the Northern NSW town of Casino at the
time. I suggested to him that Eu Lin and I drive up to visit them once
and it was a matter of extreme sensitivity. "I don't think that's a good
idea, sorry Stu", he explained. "They're country rednecks at the pub
and they won't like the look of a small Chinese woman".

I had to agree with Grahame and it was the right decision but it was
a very unique situation. This was the only Casino in the entire world
that didn't welcome Asians.

Grahame has worked in aged care for the last few years and he has a
great empathy with old people and particularly the less advantaged
in society. One of Grahame's best qualities and I hope he doesn't mind
me saying this, is that he is slow to judge.

Thank you, Grahame and Kel
################

LYNDEL ELSLEY has been my big sister for as long as Grahame has been
my brother. She was an exemplar of academic study and a wonderful
model for me to copy as I was growing up.

Lyndel is the oldest of the four Cooper siblings and at different
times has accused each of Grahame, Craig, or myself of being adopted.
After some consideration I think that if any of the four kids was
adopted, it must be Lyndel herself. Her sensible life choices and
success in life strike me as being the most un-Cooper-like.

Because of Lyndel's excellent life choices, including of course her
marriage to her husband Ron Elsley, she was able to retire
from full-time work in her forties, and concentrate on raising her
three wonderful children and pursue her interests including Musical
Theatre. Most of the Musical Theatre jokes in my speech tonight have
been for Lyndel's benefit, and the Opera references have been to
remind her that there is serious musical theatre that legitimately
cultured people are concerned with.

As the sensible person of the Cooper family, Lyndel has strong views
against gambling. Perhaps they could be expressed less judgmentally.
Nobody hates drugs more than the addicts themselves. If I could
destroy every poker machine tomorrow, I would. If I could destroy The
Star Casino tomorrow I would, although it looks like they're doing a
pretty good job of imploding without my help.

But even if you don't play games of chance, a lot of life choices are
a gamble. If you go to the movies, you're making a $25 gamble that
you'll be suitably entertained. If you choose to go to the new Snow
White remake, you're a bad gambler.

Today, Lyndel, I have placed my future, and Linus's, in the hands of a
volatile Chinese Thai woman. You'll never come into a Casino or a
Racetrack with me but you've just seen me make the biggest bet of my
life. High stakes. All-in.

Thanks, Lyndel and Ron.
################

So I've just made the biggest bet of my life and it's time for *me* to
finally relax and celebrate the win.

Send it! Send it!. Send (pause) it!

Thank you everybody.
