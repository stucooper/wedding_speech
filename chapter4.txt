Chapter 4: THANK THE GUESTS

Everyone here tonight is special and I'm going to thank you all for
coming. Not collectively, but individually.

################
MARIO COMPTANGELO is my mechanic. Since I drive
30-year-old manual cars, I need a quality mechanic who can tune my
vehicle to meet my exacting performance demands. My car spends more
time in Mario's garage than he himself does. Mario has met Yimmy a few
times during drop offs and pick ups.

Behind his back, I call him Mario Castel Sant'Angelo. The
Castel Sant'Angelo is the army barracks in Rome that Tosca jumps off
at the end of the magnificent opera by Giacomo Puccini.

Quickly on Opera, Puccini also wrote the great Opera Madam Butterfly,
about the American Navy sailor in Nagasaki who marries a teenage
Japanese girl on a month-by-month marriage; a joke to him but deadly
serious to the wife. I love to watch Madam Butterfly because I get to
see a Westerner treat Asian women even worse than I do.

Like me, Mario was married to a Singaporean Chinese lady who is no
longer with us. Mario has a half-Thai grandson and taught me an
important Thai word: "Jup", which means "Kiss me immediately".

Thank you, Mario.

STEVE CROWE is an old friend from my Newcastle days going back to High
School. Steve was in the year below mine and was in complete awe of my
academic prowess. He was a fantastic cricketer in those days and I
used to wonder why someone a year younger than me was playing in
higher grades of cricket than I was, it didn't seem fair.

Steve held fantastic State of Origin parties at his house back in the
day. Steve has strong interests in both Accountancy and Turf
Accountancy.

A few months ago Steve told me he was getting a Brazilian which had me
amazed. Does that even make sense for guys? I shaved "down there"
myself years ago... verrrry carefully. It didn't work for me but I've
seen tonight that it's working a lot better for Steve.

Thank you, Steve.

MICHAEL TILL is an IT buddy, a sports buddy and a drinking buddy.
He has German heritage and he taught me the correct pronunciation of
the German beer you call Lowenbrau but we call Lervenbroi. Michael is
here with his plus-one Natalie and I need to talk to her for a
minute.

Natalie, Michael is a fantastic guy. You already
know that, but with Michael Till you have to be careful with
the PDAs, the Public Displays of Affection. Even just walking down the
street holding hands is dangerous. That's because it's
really bad for your career if someone catches you with your hand in
The Till.

There's just enough older people here tonight to appreciate that joke
but because nobody uses cash anymore I'll have to retire the "hand in
the Till" joke. Mike, I'll ring you up in a few weeks and see if we
can't change your name to Michael Tap-and-Go, so that next time I can
warn Natalie not to get caught with her hand in the Tap-and-Go.

Michael I was going to poke a bit of good natured fun at you but
I can't. I just can't. We all heard about what happened to Triple-M
host Marty Sheargold when he made fun of Australian woman's soccer.
He lost his job and he lost it quick smart. Now this is a private
function, but anyone can get recorded on a mobile phone these days, so
I still need to be very careful what I say. So let me say this:
"I love the Tillies. The Tillies are my favourite International team.
Women's sport is so important to me, and especially Women's Soccer
which should really be called Women's Football. The Tillies are so
inspirational."

Everyone is so quick to take offence these days. 
There's a new Batman film in production where the Caped Crusader gets
in trouble for not being aware of social justice and diversity
issues. His enemy in the film is called "The Woker". Batman
tries to fight The Woker but he forgets to check his privelege and when
you live in Stately Wayne Manor you have a lot of priveleges and
unconsious biases. The Woker is offended by Bruce Wayne "Batsplaining"
the plot to him, and Batman is hauled up first before HR and finally
in front of the full Justice League. Christopher Nolan directs and
says it's a complicated story but will still make more sense than
"Tenet".

Thank you, Michael and Natalie.

DEAN TAYLOR is a man of multiple talents. I worked with Dean in the
late 1990s but after the first "Dot Com" crash, Dean escaped from IT
and now works in teaching. Dean's a Mensa member and is involved in
athletics. Dean is an excellent trivia player and pop music enthusiast
with a focus on early David Bowie. Dean lives close to the Star
Casino, and once a year Dean and I get together to watch the first TV
movie of the year, "Can't stop the Music".

Thank you, Dean.
################

LLANLEY CROWDER is my oldest friend that I met through playing
poker. Away from the tables, Llanley's an expert in sports science and
athletics performance. He actually knows Dean Taylor through
athletics, independently from me.

Llanley is a gun driver and before the Covid crisis we used to have a
few Canberra trips together. These Canberra trips were such fun that
we were considering a Perth to Sydney drive, although from the look of
things it's mostly empty desert with no other cars on the road and the
Spotto score would be very low.

Many years ago when I was down in the dumps, Llanley invited me to his
house at short notice on New Year's Eve. We drank nothing but Pepsi
Max all night, but it was a night that has not been forgotten.

Thank you, Llanley.
################

SIMON REA is my other guest tonight who I met through poker. I've
known Simon for that long that when I first met him, he didn't even
have a driver's license! Simon and his son Aiden joined Yimmy and I on
one of our first dates, which was to Olympic Park to attend a GWS game
at the small stadium there. Somehow I'd got some extra free tickets to
the game and Simon and Aiden were able to join us.

Simon and I make a trip together to Engadine four times a year, to
play a day-long Saturday poker tournament there and also to see just
what Scott Morrison did at the McDonalds there.

If everyone who played poker was of the quality and character of
Llanley Crowder and Simon Rea, poker would be much more highly regarded.

Thank you, Simon.
################

BRIAN KIM is someone who loves Aussie Rules Football almost as much
as the Australians do. We've watched games at the Sydney Cricket
Ground, Sydney Olympic Park and Manuka Oval, Canberra.

I met Brian at a performance of the adult Sesame Street
humans-and-puppets Musical, "Avenue Q". Avenue Q features the musical
standards "The Internet is for Porn" and "You can be as loud as the
hell you want, when you're making love". I won't sing these for you
right now, look them up on YouTube later.

Brian divides his time between Canberra and Sydney, and we've done a
lot of driving on the Federal Highway together. Because he's of Korean
heritage, Brian learned US-focussed English not Aussie-English so
he calls me Stoo not Stew. Brian is the only person allowed to do
that.

Thank you, Brian.
################

NICK URBANIK is my oldest IT friend from Optus. Nick and I are from
parallel universes. We both married Asiam women and we both fathered a
single child named Linus. Linus's son is Linus Urbanik. As you can
hear the pronunciation is different; but Nick can pronounce it his way
and I'll pronounce it the correct way.

Nick and I both owned a complete set of the O'Reilly books, although
last year Nick divested himself of unneeded books to the extent that I
now own two complete sets of the O'Reilly books. Nick studied IT at
University of New South Wales under professors including
John Lions who wrote the commentaries on the Unix V6 source code.

Nick is an enthusiastic bike rider and enjoys the physical sport of
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

Thank you, Nick.
################

ETHANN CASTELL is fun in human form. We met during the dot com crash
at an IBM learn to use Linux seminar. Ethann was impressed that I'd
already installed games on my seminar laptops and was at stage 2 of
the fish eating skiing game, Tux Racer. He introduced me to a business
friend of his, Greg Hickman, who gave me a Linux programming and
administration job after the dot com crash where any job was hard to
find.

Ethann originates from New Zealand and before moving to the West
Island, he had a strong interest in Rugby Union and horseracing,
particularly trotting. Ethann is a champion pinball player; it pains
me to have to admit that but after our last pinball trip to Newcastle
I had to slink off with my tail between my legs and concede his
manifest superiority.

I've never been one for buck's parties but Ethann insisted on a buck's
party which was tricky to do as he came down from Queensland for a
Thursday ceremony. Since there was midweek racing at Warwick Farm, we
went there yesterday and I put on my last losing horserace bets as a
single man.

Thank you, Ethann.
################

CHARLES CAVE was my first manager in my first IT job in Sydney way
back in 1993. He says he gave me the job because I turned up to the
interview in Chatswood with three specialised classical music CDs I
had just bought, performances by the greatest Soviet pianist of the
20th century, Sviatoslav Richter.

Charles is a highly cultured man with interests in reading,
photography, Asia, Languages, Visual Art and Classical Music.
He works with me on our on-again, on-again podcast which we call "From
Bayreuth to Baywatch: The podcast of High Culture, Low Culture and
Everything in Between".

Thank you, Charles.
################

ANTHONY CORRENTE was hired by Charles Cave two years after he hired
me, continuing Charles's record of employing absolute winners.
Anthony was my best man for my first marriage in 1998. He
was one of Eu Lin's best friends and he is also one of Linus's.

Tonight is the first time for Anthony to meet Yimmy and I'm sorry it's
taken this long Anthony but there's not much reason to go to the Hills
District these days.

Anthony broke his foot recently in what must have been a straight red
card for the defender. He's hauled himself off his deathbed to be with
us today and that's a great effort.

Anthony is one of those Italian Stallion drivers who can get to the
Sydney Football Stadium from anywhere else in Sydney in under 20
minutes, by using back streets of Five Dock and Leichardt known only
to the Italians. It was on one of these football trips to watch Sydney
FC, known to their fans as "The C", that Anthony changed my life. He
insisted that I play a car game that I'd never heard of before. Every
time I saw a yellow car, I had to be the first to yell out "Spotto".

Thank you, Anthony.
