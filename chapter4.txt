Chapter 4: THANK THE GUESTS

A few weeks ago I was doing up the guest list for tonight. I had
7 or 8 names written down from the top then Yimmy told me that no,
she didn't want any of my ex-girlfriends to come. So it was back to
square one but together we came up with a great guest list and thank
you everyone for coming along tonight.

Yimmy's friends here tonight are all very very shy. You've heard of
Mai Thai, each friend of Yimmys is a Shy Thai. So thank you all for
coming, Yimmy's friends, and I'll now get on with thanking all of my
friends. Not collectively, but individually.

################

MARIO COMPTANGELO is my mechanic. I don't like to buy cars, I like
to inherit them from my friends. I end up driving 30-year-old manual
cars, so I need an excellent mechanic who can tune my
vehicle to meet my exacting high performance demands. My car spends
more time in Mario's workshop than in my garage. Actually my car
spends more time in Mario's workshop than *Mario* spends in his
workshop.

Mario has met Yimmy a few times during drop offs and pick ups.

Behind his back, I call him Mario Castel Sant'Angelo. The
Castel Sant'Angelo is the army barracks in Rome that Tosca jumps off
at the end of the magnificent opera by Giacomo Puccini.

Quickly on Opera, Puccini also wrote the great Opera Madam Butterfly,
about the American Navy sailor BF Pinkerton in Nagasaki. Pinkerton
marries a teenage Japanese girl on a month-by-month marriage; a joke
to him but deadly serious to the wife. I love to watch Madam Butterfly
because I get to see a Westerner treat Asian women even worse than I
do.

Am Italian lady friend of mine got married to the Love Duet from
Madam Butterfly which must have jinxed the marriage. In the days of
ABC Shops and Classical Music CDs, Charles Cave once saw a bride-to-be
flicking through CDs looking for classical music for her big day. She
saw that Charles knew his stuff and she asked him if this CD with
Mozart written in giant letters on the cover might be good music to
get married to. Charles said no, it wouldn't be a good idea to walk
down the aisle to music from Mozart's Requiem Mass.

Mario has a Thai daughter-in-law and he taught me an
important Thai word: "Jup", which means "Kiss me immediately".
If "Jup" doesn't work, you say "Jup Jup" and then you get a kiss for
sure.

Thank you, Mario.
################

STEVE CROWE is an old friend from my Newcastle days going back to High
School. Steve was in the year below mine and was in complete awe of my
academic prowess. He was a fantastic cricketer in those days and I
used to wonder why someone a year younger than me was playing in
higher grades of cricket than I was, it didn't seem fair.

Steve held fantastic State of Origin parties at his house back in the
day. He has strong interests in both Accountancy and Turf
Accountancy.

Steve uses a nickname for me from my school cricket days, "Vac". I
think Grahame made it up. There's a study period that Year 12 students
get after school finishes but before their HSC exams. It's called
Study Vacation, "Stu-Vac". People started calling me "Stu-Vac" which
became simply "Vac". It's one of my favourite nicknames.

A few months ago Steve told me he was getting a Brazilian which had me
amazed. Does that even make sense for guys? I shaved "down there"
myself years ago... verrrry carefully. It didn't work for me but I'm
happy to report that it's working much better for him. She's a late
scratching tonight, but Yimmy and I look forward to meeting her in
the near future.

Thank you, Steve.
################

MICHAEL TILL is an IT buddy, a sports buddy and a drinking buddy.
He has German heritage and he taught me the correct pronunciation of
the German beer that you call Lowenbrau is actually
Lervenbroi. The German Beer that everyone calls "Becks" is really
pronounced "Becks". Kevin Rudd once said it would be a good idea if
everyone had a cup of tea, a Becks and a good lie down; I have to
disagree with him there; tea doesn't go well with Becks at all.

Michael is here with his plus-one Natalie and I need to talk to her
for a minute.

Natalie, Michael is a fantastic guy. You already
know that, but with Michael Till you have to be careful with
the PDAs, the Public Displays of Affection. Even just walking down the
street holding hands is dangerous. That's because it's
really bad for your career if someone catches you with your hand in
The Till.

There's just enough older people here tonight to appreciate that joke
but because nobody uses cash anymore I'll have to retire the "hand in
the Till" joke. Mike, I'll ring you up in a few weeks and see if we
can't change your name to Michael Tap-and-Go, so that next time I can
warn Natalie not to get caught with her hand in the Tap-and-Go.

Michael I was going to poke a bit of good natured fun at you but
I can't. I just can't. We all heard about what happened to Triple-M
host Marty Sheargold when he made fun of Australian woman's soccer.
He lost his job and he lost it quick smart. Now this is a private
function, but anyone can get recorded on a mobile phone these days, so
I still need to be very careful what I say. You just can't make
fun of the Matildas these days. You'll lose everything. So Michael:
"I love the Tillies. The Tillies are my favourite International team.
Women's sport is so important to me, and especially Women's Soccer
which should really be called Women's Football. We should build a
statue of the Tillies, they came fourth. The Tillies are so
inspirational."

Everyone is so quick to take offence these days. It's turning up in
films. There's a new Batman film in production where the Caped
Crusader gets in trouble for not being aware of progressive social
justice issues. His enemy in the film is called "The Woker".
The Woker carries an offense-gun, and every time Batman fights him,
the Woker fires the offense-gun on himself and Batman and The Woker
are transported to HR.

Batman is accused of Cultural Appropriation by stealing imagery from
the Bat Community. He also didn't check his privelege, and when you
live in Stately Wayne Manor you have a lot of privileges and
unconscious biases. Batman is brought before the full bench of the
Justice League. He calls The Woker "Arthur Fleck" and is found guilty
by the Justice League for the most heinous crime imaginable,
dead-naming. The film ends with The Woker singing a song with Lady
Gaga, who reprises her role of Harley Drag-Quinn.

Thank you, Michael and Natalie.
################

DEAN TAYLOR is a man of multiple talents. I worked with Dean in the
late 1990s but after the first "Dot Com" crash, Dean escaped from IT
and now works in teaching. Dean's a Mensa member and is involved in
athletics. Dean is an excellent trivia player and pop music enthusiast
with a focus on early David Bowie. Dean lives close to the Star
Casino, and once a year Dean and I get together to watch the first TV
movie of the New Year, The Village People origin story "Can't stop the
Music".

Thank you, Dean.
################

LLANLEY CROWDER is my oldest friend that I met through playing
poker. Away from the tables, Llanley's an expert in sports science and
athletics performance. He actually knows Dean Taylor through
athletics, independently from me.

Llanley is a gun driver and before the Covid crisis we used to have a
few Canberra trips together. These Canberra trips were such fun that
we were considering a Perth to Sydney drive, although from the look of
things it's mostly empty desert with no other cars on the road and the
Spotto score would be very low.

Llalney doesn't know this, but Club Parramatta is the venue that I've
had the most wins at, playing cards. Every Monday night I play the
game of Solo Whist here, and turn my $3 entry fee into a $5 nightly
winner's jackpot. Solo Whist is a tricks-and-trumps game where the
entire deck of 52 cards gets dealt out and four players have 13 cards
each. It's like the cardgame Bridge but all four players get to play
in every hand, and there's a hail-mary bid called Misere where you try
to lose every trick.

I'm the youngest player in the Solo Whist Club, by at least
20 years. One night I won a hand by stalling for 15 seconds, and
one of the other players had a medical episode.

Many years ago when I was down in the dumps, Llanley invited me to his
house at short notice on New Year's Eve. We drank nothing stronger
than Pepsi Max all night, but it was one of the great New Year's Eves.

Thank you, Llanley.
################

SIMON REA is my other guest tonight who I met through poker. I've
known Simon for so long that when I first met him, he didn't even
have a driver's license! Simon and his son Aiden joined Yimmy and I on
one of our very first dates, which was a footy date.

One Sunday afternoon we all caught the train to Olympic Park to attend
a GWS game at the small stadium there. I'm a GWS member, but
somehow I'd got my hands on five extra tickets, free of charge,
and free tickets to a GWS game are as rare as hens. (pause) And hens
are actually pretty common.

GWS have now given away so many free tickets that they turned up in
one of those super tricky orders-of-magnitude questions in tech
interviews for companies like Amazon and Google. Here's an actual
question from the book "Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition":

Q: Order these five quantities from smallest to largest
(a) The number of distinct IPv4 Class A addresses
(b) The number of free tickets given away by GWS in 2023 and 2024 combined.
(c) The distance in metres that light travels in a vacuum in five minutes
(d) 2 to the power of 64
(e) The number of carbon molecules in a diamond weighing 24 grams

I'll let you solve that question in your own time; for part (e) the
atomic weight of Carbon is 12 so 24 grams of Diamond has 2 times
Avogadro's constant molecules, obviously; so 6.023 x 10 to the 23
doubled which is 12.046 by 10 to the 23 which is 1.2046 x 10 to the 24
that's 1.2046 (rainman voice) "two oh four six... two oh four six"
and let's round that to 1.205 by 10 to the 24. Simple.

The speed of light question is even easier; 5 minutes is 300 seconds,
light travels 3 by 10 to the eight metres a second so we're looking at
300 x 3 x 10 to the eight which is 900 by 10 to the eight which is 9
by 10 to the 10. Trivial.

The footy date was a great success and cute young Aiden was given one
of my old GWS member's caps and I'm sure he's still wearing it today.

Simon works in IT Sales which means that every time I call him on his
mobile phone, he doesn't answer. A mutual friend once asked me
for Simon's number and I said "I'll give it to you but it's not good
for much". A week later the guy said "Yeah I shouldn't have bothered
getting it from you".

Simon loses his phone two or three times a year in taxis, Ubers or
even family picnics. He doesn't know about it until a week afterwards
and his friends don't know about it for months.

If everyone who played poker was of the quality and character of
Llanley Crowder and Simon Rea, poker would be much more highly regarded.

Thank you, Simon.
################

BRIAN KIM is someone who loves Aussie Rules Football almost as much
as the Australians do. We've watched games at the Sydney Cricket
Ground, Sydney Olympic Park and Manuka Oval, Canberra.

I first met Brian at a Chatswood performance of the adult Sesame Street
humans-and-puppets Musical, "Avenue Q", by Gilbert and Sullivan.
Avenue Q features the musical standards "The Internet is for Porn" and
"You can be as loud as the hell you want, when you're making love". I
won't sing these for you right now, look them up on YouTube later.

After Avenue Q finished, I drove Brian home using Sydney's best
street, The Commenarra Parkway; including the West Pymble Yanko Road
Suicide Dip. If they ever put speed cameras on the Commenarra Parkway,
I'll lose my licence within a month. And if Yimmy doesn't start
wearing her seatbelt over her shoulder properly, I'll also lose my
licence within a month. Thanks, Big Tech!!

Brian divides his time between Canberra and Sydney, and we've done a
lot of driving on the Federal Highway together. Because he's of Korean
heritage, Brian learned US-focussed English not Aussie-English so
he calls me Stoo not Stew. Brian is now the only one of my friends
who does that.

Thank you, Brian.
################

NICK URBANIK is my oldest IT friend from Optus. Nick and I are from
parallel universes. We both married Asian women and we both fathered a
single child named Linus. Nick's son is Linus Urbanik. As you can
hear the pronunciation is different; but Nick can pronounce it his way
and I'll pronounce it the correct way.

Nick and I both owned a complete set of the O'Reilly books, although
last year Nick divested himself of unneeded books to the extent that I
now own two complete sets of the O'Reilly books. Nick studied IT at
University of New South Wales under professors including
John Lions who wrote the commentaries on the Unix V6 source code.

A long time ago Nick and I and two other guys supported the entire
Optusnet Internet. It was a smart and capable group of people. All of
our systems ran with five-nines availability. Five nines is forty-five
so the systems were available at least forty-five percent of the
time, which is just under half the time. This is about three times as
reliable as Optus is today.

There's some smart IT guys here tonight, plus Nick, and if you listen
in to the conversations you can hear some IT funnys. "The OIE
Transaction Server, OIETS, stopped working for a minute. It was a case
of OIETS Interruptus. I saw a Perl program that counted from 1 to 10
in Persian. It used Farsi logic. Alan Turing was homogeneous. The
group uses Django, but without all the adminstration overhead, so they
use Djano Unchained. Johann Sebastic Bach had 20 children and used to
practice on a spinster in the attic. He was heterogeneous. I spent
20 minutes endorsing colleagues for their skills on LinkedIn. Suddenly
I felt a wave of happiness spreading through my body, because my brain
was releasing endorsphins".

It's like watching an episode of the Big Bang Theory, if the Big Bang
Theory was actually funny. By the way every one of those jokes, apart
from Spinster in the Attic, is a Cooper original.

Nick is an enthusiastic bike rider and enjoys the physical sport of
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

Thank you, Nick.
################

VIJESH SHETTY is the latest in a long line of IT associates to be
dazzled by my humour and skill. Competitive by nature, Vijesh assumed
the mantle of the King of Car A after I left our company a few years
ago.

Vijesh is a champion of data centres and could easily lift and rack
heavy computers which we drove from the office to Data Centres
in my old car, the Stuber car. On one of these trips, the work ran
late and it was getting close to 10pm. I'd done my bit and Vijesh
encouraged me to go home; he could get a taxi once he was done and the
company would pay for it. I stuck around an extra 40 minutes, and
drove Vijesh home myself. There was no phone reception in the data
centre so Vijesh would have had to finish the job, leave the Data
Centre and ring for a taxi, which would take seven minutes to arrive
at the data centre and would then drive him home just as fast as I did.

Vijesh is a dad and his wife and young son know that Daddy works
hard and sometimes Daddy's out late at night and sometimes Daddy's
work takes longer than expected. Vijesh and I were morning coffee
buddies, his turn my turn his turn his turn his turn but once and only
once I was able to gave Vijesh something very, very special.

I gave him seven minutes.

Thank you, Vijesh.
################

ETHANN CASTELL is fun in human form. We met during the dot com crash
at an IBM learn-to-use-Linux seminar. Ethann was impressed that I'd
already installed games on my seminar laptop and was at stage 2 of
the fish eating skiing game, Tux Racer. He introduced me to a business
friend of his, Greg Hickman, who gave me a Linux programming and
administration job at a time when any IT job was hard to find.

Ethann originates from New Zealand and before moving to the West
Island, he had a strong interest in Rugby Union and horseracing,
particularly trotting. Ethann is a champion pinball player; it pains
me to have to admit that but after our last pinball trip to Newcastle
Ethann reigns supreme. I thought I was the Bally Table King, but I
just handed my pinball crown to him.

Ethann once watched the awesome Oppenheimer film with me in bed, and
the earth moved for both of us.

A long, long, long time ago Ethann had his 40th birthday party at a
pub in Wynyard in Sydney CBD. He hired a "free function room" but he
had to put $1000 behind the bar and it was non-refundable. Some of
Ethann's guests were lightweights and just 10 minutes before the
function had to end, the bartender came up and told us there was
still $300 of free drinks left on the tab. This money was
use-it-or-lose it; so we needed to drink $300 in ten minutes.

Ethann and I sprang into action. The most expensive drink was $50
triple-shot Scotch Whiskies. We drank that $300 with a full four
minutes to spare. Amd the extra $100 each we had to pay out of our own
pockets for whiskies seven, eight, nine and ten was well worth it.

Those Whiskey drinking lessons I had all those years ago with Godfrey
Tanner really paid off that night.

I've never been one for buck's parties but Ethann insisted on a buck's
party which was tricky to do as he came down from Queensland for a
Thursday ceremony. Since there was midweek racing at Warwick Farm, we
went there yesterday and I put on my last ever losing horseracing bets
as a single man.

Thank you, Ethann.
################

CHARLES CAVE was my first manager in my first IT job in Sydney way
back in 1993. He says he gave me the job because I turned up to the
interview in Chatswood with three specialised classical music CDs
which I'd just bought from a music shop in Chatswood Westfield, which
was almost as big in 1993 as it is today. The CDs were all
performances by the greatest Soviet pianist of all time, Sviatoslav
Richter.

Sviatoslav Richter started out as a repetiteur; an accompanying
pianist at Opera and Ballet rehearsals. I've done a bit of that work
myself, many years ago I helped a semi-professional company rehearse I
Pagliacci. Despite this work, my piano career has been less successful
than Richter's. In a survey to find the best Prokofiev pianist, even
my brother Grahame chose Richter over me.

Charles is a highly cultured man with interests in reading,
photography, Asia, Languages, Visual Art and Classical Music.
He works with me on our on-again, on-again podcast which we call "From
Bayreuth to Baywatch: The podcast of High Culture, Low Culture and
Everything in Between".

Thank you, Charles.
################

ANTHONY CORRENTE was hired by Charles Cave two years after he hired
me, continuing Charles's record of employing absolute winners.
Anthony was my best man for my first marriage in 1998. He
was one of Eu Lin's best friends and he is also one of Linus's.

Tonight is the first time for Anthony to meet Yimmy and I'm sorry it's
taken this long Anthony but there's not much reason to go to the Hills
District these days.

Anthony broke his foot recently in what must have been a straight red
card for the defender. He's hauled himself off his deathbed to be with
us today and that's a great effort.

Anthony is one of those Italian Stallion drivers who can get to the
Sydney Football Stadium from anywhere else in Sydney in under 20
minutes, by using back streets of Five Dock and Leichardt known only
to true Italians. It was on one of these football trips to watch Sydney
FC, known to their fans as "The C", that Anthony changed my life. He
insisted that I play a car game that I'd never heard of before. I
thought the game was pretty stupid, but the third or fourth time I
played it started to get a little bit fun. Soon I found myself happily
shouting out the name of the game, Spotto.

Thank you, Anthony.
################

JAMES PONZA is the most naturally gifted Spotto player of his
generation. He is also sensational at IT, especially in the Optus
environment, cryptic crosswords, English language puns and has a
knowledge of classic Doctor Who that surpasses even mine.

James is also getting married in just a few months time and he's
understandably a bit nervous now that he's seen what a real man's
wedding speech looks like. You're on, kid. And it's a hard act to
follow.

James is a famous early riser, he wakes up at 4am each day. The only
time I ever wake up at 4am is to go home!

Years ago James and I went on a weight-loss program, which involved
the Keto diet and 16 kilometre daily walks. My keto chef thought the
weight loss was entirely due to Keto but I can't help thinking that 96
kilometres a week of walking also had something to do with it.

It was my first time trying to lose weight and I used to understate my
true weight by three kilograms. If the scales said 88 kilograms I
reported 85 kilograms. James said that was cheating, but I told him
that this was my first ever time trying to lose weight. I was an
Apprentice at weight-loss, and as Ethann, Steve and Grahame know full
well, Apprentices Can Claim. The second time I try weight loss,
I'll be allowed to understate my weight by 1.5 kilos. The third time
I get a 1 kilo allowance and after that I have to ride at my true
weight.

Our morning walks took in Centennial Park, Randwick racecourse, UNSW,
Coogee Bay Road then the Coogee to Bondi beach walk, after which we'd
get a coffee at the Depot and then get the Bondi to City bus back to
the car on Oxford Street, getting off a few stops early so that James
could shake me awake and we could walk one final effing kilometre.

Every morning, we passed Tamarama surf club and there was one
last hill before we'd see Bondi. James was now 2 metres in front of me
and my legs were aching. In scorching heat I traced my mate's
steps, till all hope was out of reach. When I topped the rise, wiped
my eyes, and found the legend that became a beach.

James called Spottos on the other side of the beach, two kilometres
away. He was never wrong and the morning Spotto score was typically 25
to 8. James actually thought that I'd invented Spotto, and when he
found out about it on the Internet much later he told me "You never
invented Spotto!!" and I said "of course not, I never said that I
did!!".

What sort of *idiot* thinks that I invented Spotto? Everyone knows
that Anthony Corrente invented it.

James has driven my car a few times, in the Macquarie Centre near
Optus, but the driving tester keeps failing him or failing the car.

Late last year James rejoined Optus and now works with Nick Urbanik.
in a highly specialised Optus team, Section 31.

Thank you, James.
################

MARK REAY is my best man for this ceremony. He lost his partner Louise
last year so I welcomed him to a club that does not welcome new
members; the club of men who lost their partners way too young.

As you can see Mark, it's taken me years to get over the loss of
my wife and I can tell you it will take you a long time as well.
Just a year ago I didn't think that I'd ever get over Macho Grande.

Before Louise's sudden passing, Mark, Louise, Yimmy and I went on a
few double dates. Louise had planned a Yellow Party in Mark's place at
Urunga near Coffs Harbour for the start of 2025. It's a few months
late, it's in a different city, the colour scheme is different and not
everybody can make it tonight, but I'm sure you've enjoyed tonight's
Yellow Party, Mark.

Mark works in possibly the highest pressure and most challenging part
of Optus. We're in close contact several times a week and I like to
think that along with providing him with emotional support, I also
give him a little tech support along the way.

Thank you, Mark.
################

CATHY PAN is Linus's closest friend. She disguised herself as one of
Yimmy's Bridesmaids, but I knew it was her. Cathy helped Eu Lin during
her desperate final months and she continues to help Linus, Yimmy and
I to this day.

Cathy has helped us with shopping and cooking and housework here and
there, and often I'm in the house at the same time as her and Linus is
still sleeping. I'm able to startle Cathy from a distance of 10 metres
simply by saying hi to her.

Some people have friends so close that they are honorary "aunts,
uncles, brothers or sisters" of the family. Cathy is an honorary
Cooper sister.

Thank you, Cathy.
################

There's a second honorary Cooper here tonight, and that's Cooper
behind the bar! Not everyone can be born into the Royal Family, and
not everyone can be born into a Cooper family. So in recent years,
Cooper has become a Christian name, not just a surname. The rugby
league star Cooper Cronk is the best-known Christian-name Cooper, but
an even better Cooper is Cooper behind the bar.

Tonight your drinks have been paid for by a tab. Sportstab.
I like a tab as much as the next man. Many years ago in the final
months of Eu Lin's life I was forced to stay at home on Melbourne Cup
day. I was looking at horse prices for the big race over the Internet.
My Firefox had sportstab, unitab, and tab dot com dot au all open
side-by-side at the same time. So my Firefox was a multi-tab browser.

TAB means Totalisator Agency Board and the Totalisator is an
Australian invention. It's a real-time bet-balancing machine which
means that after a horserace has finished, the State Governments of
New South Wales and Victoria take out so much money from the prizepool
that you're *still* better off betting fixed odds or from on-course
bookmakers. Australians are terrific inventors. We also invented
AFL, Wireless Networking, the Hills Hoist clothesline, and Welcome to
Country ceremonies.

When I booked the Rooftop Bar I specifically asked if Cooper could do
the drinks tonight. He knows how to pour beer and wine and his
presentation and drinks service has been, as always, first rate.

Thank you, Cooper.
################

LINUS COOPER I mentioned at the start of the speech and I do my
absolute best to never make fun of Linus at any time, especially
public events. I will share one secret; in about four weeks' time,
once his moustache and beard grow back, Linus will bear a very close
resemblance to the great Russian composer-pianist, Alexander
Scriabin.

Scriabin is one of the strangest men in Classical Music. He had
synasthesia, the multi-sensory condition where a person mixes numbers,
colours, sounds, smells and tastes. He is a very important composer
for pianists; his music forms the bridge between the greatest
pianist-composer of the 1800s, Chopin and the greatest
pianist-composers of the 1900s, Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev.

Scriabin planned to die of sexual ecstasy after the premiere of one of
his works. He was Classical Music's answer to Michael Hutchence from
INXS. He actually died from an infected pimple on his lip, which was
hiding under his moustache until it was too late.

Instead of using dull words like Andante, Allegro and Presto, Scriabin
told the performer to play "with desire" and "caress it". His late
piano music contains such powerful climaxes and orgasms that I
actually own a CD of this music that has a Parental Advisory Explicit
Lyrics warning sticker on it. That's because Grahame stuck it on
there, as a joke, but he was actually right on the money. Scriabin
should be restricted to over-18s.

Now that you know a few fun facts about the highly unusual Russian
composer Scriabin, thank you Linus!
################

GRAHAME COOPER has been my older brother for as long as I can
remember. He was a hugely attractive figure to me when I was a
kid. It wasn't just me that found Grahame attractive either; his
levels of popularity and charisma in the 1980s and 1990s were matched
only by Bob Hawke.

Grahame is here tonight with his girlfriend Kel, and Kel has recently
become a GOLF ... player. I hope I got the vowel in that word right,
Grahame. Grahame's good at golf too, Kel. Grahame you don't need me to
tell you that the most important shots in golf are the short stick
shots. Drive for show, putt for dough as the tour players say. So work
on your putting. Just keep putting it, putting it, putting it into the
hole.

Grahame wasn't able to come to my first wedding; he and his then wife
were stuck managaging a pub in the Northern NSW town of Casino.
I suggested to him that Eu Lin and I drive up to visit them but
it wasn't going to work out. "I don't think that's a good idea, sorry
Stu", he explained. "They're country rednecks up here in Casino,
especially the pub drinkers, and they won't like the look of a small
Chinese woman".

I had to agree with Grahame and it was the right decision but it was
a very unique situation. This must be the only Casino in the entire
world that doesn't welcome Asians.

Grahame has worked in aged care for a long, long time and he has a
great empathy with old people and particularly the less advantaged
in society. Twice a year Grahame engages me for a resident's
concert, and I go and play the piano for forty minutes for Aged
Care residents. Grahame introduces me and explains the music and I
must say we make a pretty good double-act. Yimmy came to our last
concert which was in Warners Bay, very close to where Sharon
Raschke gave her final concerts. I actually hit all the right notes
at Warners Bay and I didn't hear Sharon rolling in her grave
afterwards.

Thank you, Grahame and Kel
################

LYNDEL ELSLEY has been my big sister for as long as Grahame has been
my brother. She was an exemplar of academic study and a wonderful
model for me to copy as I was growing up.

Lyndel is here with her husband Ron Elsley, Big Ron. Ron comes from
Newcastle BHP royalty and his life has been industrious in every sense
of that word. Ron's the silent partner in the marriage. He doesn't say
much which means that when he does it's well worth listening to. Kinda
broad at the shoulder, and narrow at the hip. And everybody knew you
didn't give no lip, to big Ron.

Ron's mum told me that she hated the nickname Ron and she'd always
wanted people to call her son by his full name, Ronald. I told her
that if she hated the name Ron so much, she should've named him
David. Then nobody would ever call him Ron.

Lyndel is the oldest of the four Cooper siblings and at different
times has accused each of Grahame, Craig, or myself of being
adopted. After some consideration I think that if any of the four of
Mike and Ruth Cooper's kids was adopted, it must be Lyndel
herself. Her sensible life choices and success in life strike me as
being most un-Cooper-like.

Because of Lyndel's excellent life choices, including of course her
marriage to Ron, she was able to retire from full-time work in her
forties, and concentrate on raising her three wonderful children and
pursue her interests including Musical Theatre. Most of the Musical
Theatre jokes in my speech tonight have been for Lyndel's benefit, and
the Opera references have been to remind her that there is serious
musical theatre that legitimately cultured people are concerned with.

As the sensible person of the Cooper family, Lyndel has strong views
against gambling. Perhaps they could be expressed less judgmentally.
Nobody hates drugs more than the addicts themselves. If I could
destroy every poker machine tomorrow, I would. If I could destroy The
Star Casino tomorrow I would, although it looks like they're doing a
pretty good job of self-destruction without my help.

But even if you don't play games of chance, a lot of life choices are
a gamble. If you go to the movies, you're making a $25 gamble that
you'll be suitably entertained. If you choose to go to the new Snow
White remake, you're a bad gambler.

Today, Lyndel, I have placed my future, and Linus's, in the hands of a
volatile Chinese Thai woman. You'll never come into a Casino or a
Racetrack with me but you've just seen me make the biggest bet of my
life. High stakes. All-in.

Thank you, Lyndel and Ron......ald

So that's everybody thanked and it's finally time for *me* to relax
and enjoy the night. Like I said, I've just made the biggest bet of my
life and it's a winning one. I've got a special way that I celebrate
my winning bets.

Send it! Send it! Send (pause) it!

Thank you everybody.
